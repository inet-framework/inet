## Release checklist

- check if all fixed issues are correctly assigned to the milestone for this version 
- modify version number in common/INETDefs.h
- run tests
- If new NED types were added to INET, update the `doc/src/msgtags.xml` and `doc/src/nedtags.xml` files (these are part of the repo so they should be checked in). These files can be generated by running the NED Doc generator from the IDE.
- If new functionality was added, `tests/fingerprint/SelfDoc.json` must be updated by running `tests/fingerprint/fingerprinttest_selfdoc`. The `SelfDoc.json` file is part of the repo so it should be checked in.
- update the WHATSNEW file (create a section at the top for the new version based on the changelogs) the update-whatsnew script can be used for this
- tag the git repo with a vA.B.C tag
- run `releng/makedist`
- rename the created archive (remove hash from the filename)
- push the vA.B.x branch and the vA.B.C tag to the remote
- create release from the above tag on github (add release notes based on whatsnew and upload the archive)
- update models.omnetpp.org and modify the latest release version for inet.xml (for older omnetpp versions too) -> PUSH
- update inet.omnetpp.org and add new version to Download.md + add a new post in `_posts` folder -> PUSH
- update `opp_env` database. add new version to inet.py -> release a new version of opp_env by tagging it with a new version
- rebuild any INET based docker images (github.com:omnetpp/dockerfiles.git)
- rebuild INET NED reference documentation -> publish (to https://doc.omnetpp.org/inet/api-current)
- rebuild INET documentation (doc/src/dockermake html) (tutorials/showcases/userguide/developerguide)-> publish (github)
- Write an announcement email to the mailing list and on https://forum.omnetpp.org in the announcement section.
- Major/Minor releases (x.y) should be announced on the main omnetpp.org site, too.
