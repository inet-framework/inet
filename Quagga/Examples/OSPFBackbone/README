Quagga for OMNeT++

Quagga (formerly Zebra) is an open-source routing daemon package for 
Linux and other *nix systems. Quagga supports RIP, OSPF, ISIS, BGP4 and 
OSPFv6. There is currently an ongoing effort to bring dynamic routing 
facility into INET simulations by using modified version of Quagga, and
placing a syscall emulation layer between Quagga and INET Framework
components. The project is being done by Vojta Janota.

This simulation example features a 7-router OSPF backbone.
