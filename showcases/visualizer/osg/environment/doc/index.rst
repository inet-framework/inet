Visualizing the Physical Environment
====================================

Goals
-----

The physical environment has a profound effect on the communication of wireless
devices. For example, physical objects like walls inside buildings constrain
mobility. They also obstruct radio signals, often resulting in packet loss.
It is difficult to make sense of the simulation without actually seeing where
physical objects are. INET provides the visualization of these objects to
help understand the simulation better. This feature is available both in
2D and 3D visualization.

This showcase demonstrates the visualization of physical objects through displaying
the floorplan and walls of an apartment.

About the visualizer
--------------------

The :ned:`PhysicalEnvironmentVisualizer` (also part of
:ned:`IntegratedVisualizer`) is responsible for displaying the physical
objects. The objects themselves are provided by the
:ned:`PhysicalEnvironment` module; their geometry, physical and visual
properties are defined in the XML configuration of the
:ned:`PhysicalEnvironment` module.

.. note:: For more information about the XML format in which the physical environment (geometry, materials, etc.) can be defined, see the NED documentation of the :ned:`PhysicalEnvironment` module.

The two-dimensional projection of physical objects is determined by the
:ned:`SceneCanvasVisualizer` module. (This is because the projection is
also needed by other visualizers, for example, :ned:`MobilityVisualizer`.)
The default view is the top view (z-axis), but you can also configure side
view (x and y axes), or isometric or orthographic projection.

The default view
----------------

This example configuration (``DefaultView`` in the ini file)
demonstrates the default visualization of objects. The objects are
defined in the ``indoor.xml`` file, which depicts an apartment with
three rooms. The network contains just two modules, a
:ned:`PhysicalEnvironment` and an :ned:`IntegratedVisualizer` module. When the
simulation is run, the network looks like this:

.. figure:: media/default.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

The isometric view
------------------

In this example configuration (``IsometricView`` in the ini file), the
view is set to isometric projection by setting the
:par:`viewAngle` parameter in :ned:`SceneVisualizer`:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: viewAngle
   :end-at: viewAngle
   :language: ini

When the simulation is run, the network looks like the following.

.. figure:: media/isometric.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

3D visualization
----------------

The visualizer also supports OpenGL-based 3D rendering using the
OpenSceneGraph (OSG) library. If your OMNeT++ installation has been
compiled with OSG support, you can switch to 3D view using the toolbar.
The result will look like the following. Note that the
:ned:`SceneVisualizer` view settings have no effect on the 3D view; you can
use the mouse to move the camera and change the view angle.

.. figure:: media/3d.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center
