Visualizing Network Nodes
=========================

Goals
-----

INET offers several options for visualizing network nodes in 2D (canvas) and 3D
(OSG) views. This provides a visually appealing representation of the network,
and customizing the appearance can also aid in highlighting important nodes or
differentiating them based on location or function. Options include specifying
icons, 3D models, and colorization.

This showcase demonstrates the visualization options for network nodes in
simulations and how to customize their appearance.

.. note:: This showcase requires OMNeT++ built with OSG enabled.

About the Visualizer
--------------------

In INET simulations, :ned:`NetworkNodeVisualizer` module (included in the
network as part of :ned:`IntegratedVisualizer`) is responsible for
visualizing network nodes. :ned:`NetworkNodeVisualizer` includes two
submodules: :ned:`NetworkNodeCanvasVisualizer`, which is responsible for
visualizing nodes on the 2D canvas, and :ned:`NetworkNodeOsgVisualizer`,
which visualizes nodes in 3D scenes.
Both visualizer modules operate on all network nodes by default, but you can narrow
the list of nodes to be displayed by using the :par:`nodeFilter` parameter.

Visualization on the 2D canvas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the 2D canvas, each node is represented by an icon, which can
be displayed in various sizes and can also be colorized.

The icon of the node can be customized by setting the display string of the
node in the network description (NED). Display strings, which appear
as ``@display`` properties in NED, are explained in the
`OMNeT++ Simulation Manual <https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/manual/#sec:graphics:display-strings>`__.

Display strings consist of tags, and ``i`` defines the icon. It has three arguments.
The first one selects the icon itself. The second and third define colorization:
a color (color name or HTML-style RGB) and a colorization percentage.
Icon size is denoted by an abbreviation (``vs`` for very small, ``s`` for small,
``n`` for normal, ``l`` for large and ``vl`` for very large) and can be
specified either as a suffix on the icon name (``node/router_vl``), or
with the ``is`` display string tag.

The above display string based visualization, being an OMNeT++ mechanism,
does not require :ned:`NetworkNodeCanvasVisualizer` to be present. However,
:ned:`NetworkNodeCanvasVisualizer` is required for several other visualizers
(e.g. those that display annotations around the node icon) to work.
In addition, :ned:`NetworkNodeCanvasVisualizer` lets you use an arbitrary image
(not just an icon) for a node, by setting the node's :par:`canvasImage` and
:par:`canvasImageColor` parameters.


Visualization on a 3D scene
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ned:`NetworkNodeOsgVisualizer` is responsible for displaying nodes on a 3D
scene. (Note that :ned:`IntegratedVisualizer`'s :par:`osgVisualizerType`
parameter must be set to ``"IntegratedOsgVisualizer"`` to visualize nodes in 3D.)
OMNeT++'s 3D visualization is based on the open-source OpenSceneGraph (OSG) and osgEarth
libraries. These libraries offer high-level functionality, such as the
ability of using 3D model files directly, accessing and rendering online
map and satellite imagery data sources, and so on. In this showcase, we
deal only with 3D models (and not with maps -- displaying maps is
covered in other showcases).

By default, each node is represented in the 3D scene with the same
icon used in the 2D canvas. If you want to replace the 2D icon, you need
to reference an external resource, for example an image or a
3D model file. The resource should be specified in the node's :par:`osgModel`
parameter. By default, the OMNeT++ image path is used to find the
image. OSG supports several 3D model (3dc, 3ds, flt, geo, iv, ive,
lwo, md2, obj, osg, osgb, etc.) and image file formats (bmp, gif,
jpg, png, rgb, tga, tif, etc.)

There is support for so-called "pseudo loaders" in OSG, which provide
additional options for loading 3D models. Pseudo loaders perform basic
transformations on the 3D model after it is loaded.
To use pseudo loaders, append modifiers to the end of the file name:

-  The ``scale`` modifier multiplies the size of the model by a
   certain factor. The format is ``f.scale``, where ``f`` is the numeric
   factor. If a decimal fraction is used, it must be enclosed
   in parentheses, as in ``(0.8).scale``.
-  The ``trans`` modifier translates the model along the X, Y and Z axes
   by the given values. The format is ``X,Y,Z.trans``.
-  The ``rot`` modifier rotates the model around the X, Y and Z axes.
   The format of the ``rot`` pseudo loader is ``X,Y,Z.rot``,
   with the values given in degrees.

The modifiers should be separated by dots. Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: none

   *.exampleNode.osgModel = "example.osg.2.scale.0,0,10.trans.180,0,90.rot"

-  ``example.osg`` is the file name of the external 3D model that
   represents the ``exampleNode`` network node,
-  ``2.scale`` scales ``example.osg`` to 200%,
-  ``0,0,10.trans`` translates ``example.osg`` 10 units upwards,
-  ``180,0,90.rot`` rotates ``example.osg`` 180 degrees around the X
   axis and 90 degrees around the Z axis,

The color of the model also can be changed by using the
:par:`osgModelColor` parameter. This parameter accepts English color names
(more precisely, SVG color names) and HTML-style RGB values.

Displaying the node name is also optional: it is displayed by default
but can be hidden by setting the visualizer's :par:`displayModuleName`
parameter to ``false``.

Examples
--------

The following examples use the same network. The network contains two
network nodes, ``pedestrian`` and ``car``. Both of them are of the
type :ned:`AdhocHost`, which has a cellphone icon by default.

Canvas (2D view)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, the node icons have been changed from the default
by modifying the corresponding submodule display strings
in the NED definition of the network.
The ``p`` display string tag defines the position of the nodes.
On the 2D canvas, the (0,0) position is in the upper left corner of the
playground.

.. literalinclude:: ../NetworkNodeVisualizerShowcase.ned
   :start-at: car
   :end-at: }
   :language: ned

.. literalinclude:: ../NetworkNodeVisualizerShowcase.ned
   :start-at: pedestrian
   :end-at: }
   :language: ned

The simulation can be "run" (it does nothing) by selecting the ``Canvas``
configuration from ``omnetpp.ini``. You should see the following:

.. figure:: media/IconsOnCanvas_v0111.png
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

The canvas displays a man and a car icon that represent the nodes.

Default 3D view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The OSG-based 3D view can be enabled by adding any visualizer module
that uses it. In our case, we add a :ned:`NetworkNodeOsgVisualizer`
by enabling it in :ned:`IntegratedVisualizer`.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: osgVisualizer.typename
   :end-at: osgVisualizer.typename
   :language: ini

When you run the ``Basic3D`` configuration on the ini file, you should
see something like the following:

.. figure:: media/IconsOnOsgscene_v0111.png
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

By default, nodes are displayed on the 3D scene using the same icons as
on the 2D canvas. The playground axes are also displayed in the above
screenshot (for brevity, the corresponding configuration lines have been
omitted from the ini file).

Using 3D models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In our next experiment, we replace the icon of the nodes with external
3D models, ``boxman.osgb`` and the ``car.osgb``. The models will be scaled
in order to be proportionate to each other.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: car.osgModel
   :end-at: pedestrian.osgModel
   :language: ini

You can run the simulation by selecting the ``Using3DModels`` configuration
from the ini file. The following animation shows how the nodes look
like after we have replaced their icons with 3D models.

.. video:: media/ModelsLoaded.mp4
   :width: 80%

The ``pedestrian`` node is represented by an animated walking boxman, and
the ``car`` node is represented by a car model.

Adjusting orientation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The orientation of network nodes is updated by their own mobility
submodules. It is possible that the orientation of the 3D model does not
match the orientation of the node. For example, when we add motion
to our previous configuration (select ``AddingMovement`` from the ini file),
the boxman will walk sideways:

.. video:: media/PedestrianMovesSideways.mp4
   :width: 80%

The orientation of the 3D model can be initialized by the ``rot`` pseudo
loader. If the node is a mobile node then the mobility submodule of the
node will manage future rotations of the node during the simulation. To
achieve the correct orientation, the ``pedestrian`` 3D model should be
rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise around the Z axis.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: 90.rot
   :end-at: 90.rot
   :language: ini

.. video:: media/NodesOrientationIsRight.mp4
   :width: 80%

The above animation shows that both 3D models' orientation is correct.
They are initialized by pseudo loaders and updated by the mobility model
of the network node.
