Visualizing Data Link Activity
==============================

Goals
-----

Visualizing network traffic is an important aspect of running simulations. INET
provides various visualizers to help you understand the network activity,
including the :ned:`DataLinkVisualizer`, which focuses on the data link level. This
module allows you to see the visual representation of the data link level traffic
in the form of arrows that fade as the traffic ceases.

This showcase features five different simulation models, each designed to
demonstrate different capabilities of the data link activity visualizer.

About the Visualizer
--------------------

In INET, data link activity can be visualized by including a
:ned:`DataLinkVisualizer` module in the simulation. Adding an
:ned:`IntegratedVisualizer` module is also an option because it also
contains a :ned:`DataLinkVisualizer` module. Data link visualization is
disabled by default; it can be enabled by setting the visualizer's
:par:`displayLinks` parameter to true.

:ned:`DataLinkVisualizer` can observe packets at the *service*, *peer*,
and *protocol* level. The level where packets are observed can be set by
the :par:`activityLevel` parameter.

- At the *service* level, those packets are displayed which pass through
  the data link layer (i.e. carry data from/to higher layers).
- At the *peer* level, the visualization is triggered by those packets
  which are processed inside the link layer in the source node and
  processed inside the link layer in the destination node.
- At the *protocol* level, :ned:`DataLinkVisualizer` displays those packets
  which are going out at the bottom of the link layer in the source node
  and going in at the bottom of the link layer in the destination node.

The activity between two nodes is represented visually by an arrow that
points from the sender node to the receiver node. The arrow appears
after the first packet has been received, then gradually fades out
unless it is refreshed by further packets. The style, color, fading time,
and other graphical properties can be changed with parameters of the
visualizer.

By default, all packets, interfaces, and nodes are considered for the
visualization. This selection can be narrowed down to certain packets and/or
nodes with the visualizer's :par:`packetFilter`, :par:`interfaceFilter`, and
:par:`nodeFilter` parameters.

Enabling Visualization of Data Link Activity
--------------------------------------------

The following example shows how to enable the visualization of data link
activity and what the visualization looks like. In the first example,
we configure a simulation for a wired network. The simulation can be run
by choosing the ``EnablingVisualizationWired`` configuration from the
ini file.

The wired network contains two :ned:`StandardHost`s, ``wiredSource`` and
``wiredDestination``. The ``linkVisualizer`` module's type is
:ned:`DataLinkVisualizer`.

.. figure:: media/DataLinkVisualizerSimpleWired.png
   :width: 100%

In this configuration, ``wiredSource`` pings ``wiredDestination``. Data
link activity visualization is enabled by setting the ``displayLinks``
parameter to true.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: displayLinks
   :end-at: displayLinks
   :language: ini

The following video shows what happens when the simulation is started.

.. video:: media/EnablingVisualizationWired_v0613.m4v
   :width: 100%

At the beginning of the video, a red strip appears and moves from
``wiredSource`` to ``wiredDestination``. This strip is the standard
OMNeT++ animation for packet transmissions and has nothing to do with
:ned:`DataLinkVisualizer`. When the packet is received in whole by
``wiredDestination`` (the red strip disappears), a dark cyan arrow is
added by :ned:`DataLinkVisualizer` between the two hosts, indicating data
link activity. The packet's name is also displayed on the arrow. The arrow
quickly fades out because the :par:`fadeOutTime` parameter of the
visualizer is set to a small value.

Visualization in a wireless network is very similar. Our next example is
the wireless variant of the above simulation. In this network, we use two
:ned:`AdhocHost`s, ``wirelessSource`` and ``wirelessDestination``. The
traffic and the visualization settings are the same as the configuration
of the wired example. The simulation can be run by choosing the
``EnablingVisualizationWireless`` configuration from the ini file.

.. figure:: media/DataLinkVisualizerSimpleWireless.png
   :width: 100%

The following animation depicts what happens when the simulation is run.

.. video:: media/EnablingVisualizationWireless_v0613.m4v
   :width: 100%

This animation is similar to the video of the wired example (apart from
an extra blue dotted line which can be ignored, as it is also part of
the standard OMNeT++ packet animation). Note, however, that the ACK
frame does not activate the visualization because ACK frames do not
pass through the data link layer.

Filtering Data Link Activity
----------------------------

In complex networks with many nodes and several protocols in use, it is
often useful to be able to filter network traffic and visualize only
the part of the traffic we are interested in. The following example
shows how to set packet filtering in :ned:`DataLinkVisualizer`. This
simulation can be run by choosing the ``Filtering`` configuration from
the ini file.

We use the following network for this showcase.

.. figure:: media/DataLinkVisualizerFiltering.png
   :width: 100%

This network consists of four switches (``etherSwitch1..etherSwitch4``)
and six endpoints: two source hosts (``source1``, ``source2``), two
destination hosts (``destination1``, ``destination2``), and two other
hosts (``host1``, ``host2``) which are inactive in this simulation.
``Source1`` pings ``destination1``, and ``source2`` pings
``destination2``.

For this network, the visualizer's type is :ned:`IntegratedVisualizer`.
Data link activity visualization is filtered to display only ping
messages. The other packets, e.g., ARP packets, are not visualized by
:ned:`DataLinkVisualizer`. We adjust the ``fadeOutMode`` and the
:par:`fadeOutTime` parameters so that the activity arrows do not fade out
completely before the next ping messages are sent.

We use the following configuration for the visualization.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: dataLinkVisualizer.displayLinks
   :end-at: dataLinkVisualizer.packetFilter
   :language: ini

The following animation shows what happens when we start the simulation.
You can see that although there is both ARP and ping traffic in the
network, :ned:`DataLinkVisualizer` only takes the latter into account due
to the presence of the :par:`packetFilter` parameter.

.. video:: media/Filtering_v0613.m4v
   :width: 100%

It is also possible to filter for network nodes. For the following
example, let's assume we want to display traffic between the hosts
``source1`` and ``destination1`` only, along the path ``etherSwitch1``,
``etherSwitch4``, and ``etherSwitch2``. To this end, we set the
visualizer's :par:`nodeFilter` parameter using the following line (note
the curly brace syntax used for specifying numeric substrings).

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: dataLinkVisualizer.nodeFilter
   :end-at: dataLinkVisualizer.nodeFilter
   :language: ini

It looks like the following when we run the simulation.

.. video:: media/Filtering2_v0613.m4v
   :width: 100%

As you can see, visualization allows us to follow the ping packets
between ``source1`` and ``destination1``. Note, however, that ping
traffic between the two other hosts ``source2`` and ``destination2``
also activates the visualization on the link between ``etherSwitch1``
and ``etherSwitch4``.

Displaying Data Link Activity at Different Levels
-------------------------------------------------

The following example demonstrates how to visualize data link activity
at the *protocol*, *peer*, and *service* levels. This simulation can be run by
selecting the ``ActivityLevel`` configuration from the ini file.

We use the following wireless network for this example.

.. figure:: media/ActivityLevel_v1206.png
   :width: 100%

The network consists of three :ned:`AdhocHost` nodes: ``person1``, ``person2``,
and ``videoServer``. ``VideoServer`` will be streaming a video to
``person1``. ``Person2`` will be inactive in this example.

The type of the visualizer module is :ned:`IntegratedMultiVisualizer`.
Multi-visualizers are compound visualizer modules containing submodule
vectors of visualizer simple modules. By default, the multi-visualizers
contain one submodule of each visualizer simple module. The number of
submodules can be specified with parameters for each visualizer
submodule.

In this example, data link activity will be displayed at three different
levels. To achieve this, three :ned:`DataLinkVisualizer` modules will be
configured, observing packets at *service*, *peer*, and *protocol* level.
They are marked with different colors. The ``visualizer`` module is
configured as follows.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: numDataLinkVisualizers
   :end-at: dataLinkVisualizer[2].labelColor
   :language: ini

By using the :par:`numDataLinkVisualizers` parameter, we set up three
:ned:`DataLinkVisualizer` modules. In this example, we are interested in
*video* packets. To highlight them, we use the :par:`packetFilter`
parameter. The :par:`fadeOutMode` parameter specifies that inactive links
fade out during animation time. The :par:`holdAnimationTime` parameter stops
the animation for a while, delaying the fading of the data link activity
arrows. The ``activityLevel``, ``lineColor``, and ``labelColor``
parameters are different for each :ned:`DataLinkVisualizer` to make data
link activity levels easy to distinguish:

- ``dataLinkVisualizer[0]`` is configured to display *protocol* level
  activity with purple arrows.
- ``dataLinkVisualizer[1]`` is configured to display *peer* level
  activity with blue arrows.
- ``dataLinkVisualizer[2]`` is configured to display *service* level
  activity with green arrows.

The following video shows what happens when the simulation is running.

.. video:: media/ActivityLevel_v0104.mp4
   :width: 100%

At the beginning of the video, ``person1`` sends a ``VideoStrmReq``
packet, requesting the video stream. In response to this,
``videoServer`` starts to send video stream packet fragments to
``person1``. The packets are fragmented because their size is larger
than the Maximum Transmission Unit. The first packet fragment,
``VideoStrmPk-frag0``, causes data link activity only at the *protocol* level
and at the *peer* level because other packet fragments are required to
allow the packet to be forwarded to higher layers. When
``VideoStrmPk-frag1`` is received by ``person1``, the packet is
reassembled and is sent to the upper layers. As a result, a
green arrow is displayed between ``videoServer`` and ``person1``,
representing data link activity at the *service* level.

Another phenomenon that can be observed in the video is the
*protocol*-level data link activity between ``person2`` and the other
nodes. This activity is because frames are also received at the physical layer
of ``person2``, but they are dropped at the data link layer level because
they are not addressed to ``person2``.

Visualizing Data Link Activity in a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network
---------------------------------------------------------

The following simulation shows how visualization can help you to follow
dynamically changing data link activity in a wireless environment. The
simulation can be run by choosing the ``Dynamic`` configuration from the
ini file.

We use the following network for this simulation:

.. figure:: media/DataLinkVisualizerDynamic.png
   :width: 100%

Nodes are of the type :ned:`AodvRouter` and are placed randomly on the
scene. The communication range of the nodes is chosen so that the
network is connected, but nodes can typically only communicate by using
multi-hop paths. The nodes will also randomly roam within predefined
borders. The routing protocol is AODV. During the simulation, the
``source`` node will be pinging the ``destination`` node.

In our first experiment, the goal is to visualize the operation of the
AODV protocol as it sets up a route from ``source`` to ``destination``.
We expect to see the following. As long as ``source`` has a valid route
towards ``destination``, AODV is inactive. When a new route is needed
towards ``destination``, ``source`` starts to flood the network with
AODV route request (RREQ) messages. RREQ messages propagate through the
intermediate nodes until one of them reaches the ``destination`` node.
The route is made available by unicasting AODV route reply (RREP)
messages back to the originator of the RREQ messages. Reception of the
RREP message in each host results in the node updating its routing table
with the next hop address towards the destination node.

As AODV operates with two message types, we'll use two
:ned:`DataLinkVisualizer` modules configured to use two different colors.

.. code-block:: ini

   *.rreqVisualizer.*.displayLinks = true
   *.rreqVisualizer.*.packetFilter = "AodvRreq"
   *.rreqVisualizer.*.fadeOutMode = "simulationTime"
   *.rreqVisualizer.*.fadeOutTime = 0.002s
   *.rrepVisualizer.*.displayLinks = true
   *.rrepVisualizer.*.packetFilter = "AodvRrep"
   *.rrepVisualizer.*.fadeOutMode = "simulationTime"
   *.rrepVisualizer.*.fadeOutTime = 5s
   *.rrepVisualizer.*.lineColor = "blue"
   *.rrepVisualizer.*.labelColor = "blue"

The following video has been captured from the simulation and allows us
to observe the AODV protocol in action. The dark cyan arrows indicate
RREQ packets which flood the network. When an RREQ message reaches
``destination``, ``destination`` sends an RREP message (blue arrow) back
towards ``source``. Note that nodes appear stationary because the whole
process takes place in a very short time period.

.. video:: media/AODV_v0614.m4v
   :width: 100%

In the second experiment, we configure the visualizer to display only
the ping traffic between ``source`` and ``destination``. (The AODV
visualizers will be disabled.) We'll simulate a longer time period so
that nodes move around in the scene, forcing AODV to find new
routes from time to time.

We use the following configuration for the visualization.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-after: Filtering ping packets
   :end-at: fadeOutTime
   :language: ini

The following animation illustrates what happens when the simulation is
run.

.. video:: media/Dynamic_v0613.m4v
   :width: 100%

The communication ranges of ``source`` and ``destination`` are
visualized as blue circles.

The video clearly shows the route ping packets are taking between
``source`` and ``destination``. Visualization is triggered by the ping
packets being sent up from the data link layer (wireless interface) of
the receiver node to the network layer (IPv4), where they are routed
towards the next hop.

When the existing route breaks due to two nodes drifting away (out of
the communication range of each other), this manifests as a link-level
failure (ACK frames do not arrive). This condition is detected by AODV,
and it starts searching for a new route. When the new route is found,
the ping traffic resumes.

We can observe in the video that the route the ping packets take is not
always optimal (in terms of hop count). The reason is that nodes use an
existing route as long as possible, even when a shorter route becomes
available as a result of node movement. AODV is only activated when the
existing route breaks.
