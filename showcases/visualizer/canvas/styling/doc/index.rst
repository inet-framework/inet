Styling and Appearance
======================

Goals
-----

INET visualizers offer a range of customization options, allowing you to tailor
the appearance of your simulation to your needs. This includes adjusting colors,
line widths, sizes, and placements, among other things. These
customization options can enhance the visual appeal and clarity of your
simulation, particularly when multiple visualizations are enabled.

This showcase features four examples that illustrate how to customize lines,
arrows, icons, fonts, and annotations.

Customizing Lines and Arrows
----------------------------

.. These customization options are named consistently across all visualizers.

In INET simulations, links and packet paths are visualized as arrows.
When too many links and paths are visualized in a simulation, it can be
difficult to find which arrows correspond to the links or paths that we
are interested in. In such a case, arrow customization may be used to
make the interesting arrows stand out more.

This showcase contains an example simulation where arrows are
customized. The simulation can be run by selecting the ``Line``
configuration from the ini file.

The network consists of two nodes, ``host1`` and ``host2``, which
communicate wirelessly, and we customize data link activity arrows. The
following configuration is used for the visualizer:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-after: Customizing Lines
   :end-at: dataLinkVisualizer.lineShift
   :language: ini

Here are the differences between the default
and the customized visualization:

.. figure:: media/Line_default_v0727.png
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

.. figure:: media/Line_custom_v0727.png
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

The :par:`lineColor` parameter specifies the color of the arrow, and it
accepts English color names (more precisely, SVG color names) and
HTML-style RGB values. For the :ned:`NetworkRouteVisualizer`,
:ned:`TransportRouteVisualizer` and :ned:`MobilityVisualizer` modules,
``lineColor`` may be set to a list of colors separated by commas, or to
the ``dark`` and ``light`` keywords which will be interpreted as a list
of good dark (light) colors. The :par:`lineStyle` parameter can be set to
``solid``, ``dotted`` or ``dashed``. Line width is controlled by the
:par:`lineWidth` parameter. If there are multiple lines between the same
nodes, the space between the lines can be changed by adjusting the
:par:`lineShift` parameter. The space between the end of the arrow and the
network node can be adjusted by setting the ``lineContactSpacing``
parameter.

Customizing Labels
------------------

Lines and arrows often have labels placed next to them for displaying
additional information. Customizing the font or color of such labels is
often useful, for example, to highlight important information.

The example simulation can be run by choosing the ``Font`` configuration
from the ini file. The network is the same as in the previous example:
two hosts communicating wirelessly. We customize the font used in labels
on data link activity arrows.

To customize the fonts used in labels, we configure
:ned:`DataLinkVisualizer` in the following way:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-after: # Customizing Fonts
   :end-at: dataLinkVisualizer.labelColor
   :language: ini

Here are the differences between the default
and the customized visualization:

.. figure:: media/Font_default_v0727.png
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

.. figure:: media/Font_custom_v0727.png
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

Font family, font size and font style can be set by using the
:par:`labelFont` parameter. You can omit any value from the parameter if
you do not want to change that. For example, you can set ``labelFont``
to ``"bold"``, so that font family and font size remain unchanged. The
:par:`labelColor` parameter can be set to a single color by using a color
name or an HTML-style RGB value.

Labels are enabled by default. (Labels can be disabled by setting the
:par:`displayLabels` parameter to false.)

For :ned:`InterfaceTableVisualizer` and :ned:`StatisticVisualizer`, the
:par:`font` parameter is used instead of :par:`labelFont`, and :par:`textColor`
is used instead of :par:`labelColor`.

Customizing Icons
-----------------

Some visualizers, such as :ned:`TransportConnectionVisualizer`, display
icons. The following example shows how to customize icon appearance in
INET.

The simulation can be run by choosing the ``Icon`` configuration from
the ini file. The network is the same as in the previous examples: two
hosts communicating wirelessly. This time, however, we add TCP traffic
between them, so that we can show how the icons displayed by
:ned:`TransportConnectionVisualizer` can be customized.

We use the following configuration to customize the transport connection
icons:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-after: # Customizing Icons
   :end-at: transportConnectionVisualizer.iconColor
   :language: ini

Here are the differences between the default
and the customized visualization:

.. figure:: media/Icon_default_v0727.png
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

.. figure:: media/Icon_custom_v0727.png
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

The :par:`icon` parameter specifies the icon to be used. The OMNeT++ image
path is used to find the image, just like with the ``i`` display string
tag or the ``cIconFigure`` class. In our case, the ``misc/marker2`` name
resolves to the ``inet/images/misc/marker2.png`` file:

.. figure:: media/marker2.png
   :width: 24
   :align: center

The :par:`iconColor` parameter allows you to colorize (tint) the icon. As
:ned:`TransportConnectionVisualizer` potentially displays several icons per
network node, the parameter accepts a (space-separated) list of colors,
and the module will cycle through them as it assigns colors to icons. It
also accepts the ``dark`` and ``light`` keywords, which will be
interpreted as a list of good dark (light) colors.

The :ned:`LinkBreakVisualizer` and :ned:`PacketDropVisualizer` modules have an
:par:`iconTintColor` parameter instead of :par:`iconColor`. However, note,
that :par:`iconTintColor` can be set only to a single color. These
visualizers also have an :par:`iconTintAmount` parameter. By adjusting
:par:`iconTintAmount`, the colorization amount of the icon can be adjusted
between zero and one. If we set the parameter to zero, the icon will not
be tinted at all. If the parameter is set to one, the icon will be
tinted fully.

Placing Annotations
-------------------

When many annotations are placed around a network node, being able to
control their placement can reduce clutter and make the simulation more
comprehensible.

The following example shows how to control the placement of annotations.
The simulation can be run by selecting the ``Annotation`` configuration
from the ini file. The network is the same as in the previous example.
The simulation will set up several TCP connections between the two
hosts, and :ned:`TransportConnectionVisualizer` will be used to visualize
them as marker icons.

We use the following configuration to place the annotation icons.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-after: # Placing Annotations
   :end-at: placementHint
   :language: ini

Here are the differences between the default
and the customized visualization:

.. figure:: media/Annotation_default_v0802.png
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

.. figure:: media/Annotation_custom_v0802.png
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

The :par:`placementHint` parameter determines where the annotations will be
placed. The annotations can be placed in eight directions around the
node: ``topCenter``, ``left``, ``right``, ``bottomCenter``, ``topLeft``,
``topRight``, ``bottomLeft``, ``bottomRight``. The ``placementHint``
parameter may contain one or more of those words, denoting the preferred
direction(s). The word ``top`` is an abbreviation for
``topLeft topCenter topRight``; ``bottom``, ``left``, and ``right`` are
similar abbreviations. There is also ``any``, which is the union of all
eight directions. When ``placementHint`` is set to ``any``, annotations
will be placed as close as possible to the node.

The order of annotation positioning can be controlled by using the
:par:`placementPriority` parameter that takes an integer. Zero is the
largest priority.

Try It Yourself
---------------

If you already have INET and OMNeT++ installed, start the IDE by typing
``omnetpp``, import the INET project into the IDE, then navigate to the
``inet/showcases/visualizer/canvas/styling`` folder in the `Project Explorer`. There, you can view
and edit the showcase files, run simulations, and analyze results.

Otherwise, there is an easy way to install INET and OMNeT++ using `opp_env
<https://omnetpp.org/opp_env>`__, and run the simulation interactively.
Ensure that ``opp_env`` is installed on your system, then execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env run inet-4.5 --init -w inet-workspace --install --build-modes=release --chdir \
       -c 'cd inet-4.5.*/showcases/visualizer/canvas/styling && inet'

This command creates an ``inet-workspace`` directory, installs the appropriate
versions of INET and OMNeT++ within it, and launches the ``inet`` command in the
showcase directory for interactive simulation.

Alternatively, for a more hands-on experience, you can first set up the
workspace and then open an interactive shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env install --init -w inet-workspace --build-modes=release inet-4.5
    $ cd inet-workspace
    $ opp_env shell

Inside the shell, start the IDE by typing ``omnetpp``, import the INET project,
then start exploring.
