Visualizing IPv4 Routing Tables
===============================

Goals
-----

Determining the routes that IPv4 packets take in a multi-hop network can be a
tedious task. The routing information is stored in the IPv4 routing tables of
the network nodes, which are scattered throughout the network, making it
difficult to get a comprehensive view. INET offers a visualizer that can
graphically display the routing information, making it easier to understand the
routing in a simulation without having to inspect individual routing tables.

This showcase includes three simulation models of increasing complexity,
demonstrating the different features of routing table visualization.

About the visualizer
--------------------

In INET, the :ned:`RoutingTableVisualizer` module (included in the network
as part of :ned:`IntegratedVisualizer`) is responsible for visualizing
routing table entries.

The visualizer basically annotates network links with labeled arrows
that connect source nodes to next hop nodes. The module visualizes those
routing table entries that participate in the routing of a given set of
destination addresses, by default the addresses of all interfaces of all
nodes in the network. That is, it selects the best (longest prefix)
matching routes for all destination addresses from each routing table,
and shows them as arrows that point to the next hop. Note that one arrow
might need to represent several routing entries, for example when
distinct prefixes are routed towards the same next hop.

Routing table entries are represented visually by solid arrows. An arrow
going from a source node represents a routing table entry in the source
node's routing table. The endpoint node of the arrow is the next hop in
the visualized routing table entry. By default, the routing entry is
displayed on the arrows in the following format: ``destination/mask -> gateway (interface)``

The format can be changed by setting the visualizer's ``labelFormat``
parameter.

Filtering is also possible. The :par:`nodeFilter` parameter controls which
nodes' routing tables should be visualized (by default, all nodes), and
the :par:`destinationFilter` parameter selects the set of destination nodes
to consider (again, by default all nodes).

The visualizer reacts to changes. For example, when a routing protocol
changes a routing entry, or an IP address gets assigned to an interface
by DHCP, the visualizer automatically updates the visualizations
according to the specified filters. This feature is very useful, e.g. for the
simulation of mobile ad-hoc networks.

Displaying all routing tables
-----------------------------

The following example demonstrates how to enable the visualization of
routing tables, and how the visualization looks like. The simulation can
be run by choosing the ``DisplayingAll`` configuration from the ini
file. The network for the simulation contains two :ned:`StandardHost`'s,
each connected to a :ned:`Router`. IP addresses are assigned by the
:ned:`Ipv4NetworkConfigurator` module, which also fills in the routing tables
automatically. The visualizer module is an :ned:`IntegratedVisualizer`
which contains all available visualizers as submodules.

The configuration contains one line, which enables the visualization of
routing tables with the :par:`displayRoutingTables` parameter:

.. code-block:: none

   *.visualizer.displayRoutingTables = true

All other parameters of the visualizer are left on default.

When the simulation is run, the network looks like this:

.. figure:: media/displayroutes4.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

Note that IP addresses are displayed above the nodes. These annotations have nothing
to do with the :ned:`RoutingTableVisualizer`; they are displayed because we
configured it in :ned:`InterfaceTableVisualizer` to improve clarity.

Here are the routing tables of the two hosts and the router, with the
visualized entries highlighted:

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 5,11,16,17

   Node RoutingTableVisualizationDisplayingAllShowcase.hostA
   -- Routing table --
   Destination      Netmask          Gateway          Iface           Metric
   10.0.0.0         255.255.255.252  *                eth0 (10.0.0.1) 0
   *                *                10.0.0.2         eth0 (10.0.0.1) 0

   Node RoutingTableVisualizationDisplayingAllShowcase.hostB
   -- Routing table --
   Destination      Netmask          Gateway          Iface           Metric
   10.0.0.4         255.255.255.252  *                eth0 (10.0.0.5) 0
   *                *                10.0.0.6         eth0 (10.0.0.5) 0

   Node RoutingTableVisualizationDisplayingAllShowcase.router
   -- Routing table --
   Destination      Netmask          Gateway          Iface           Metric
   10.0.0.0         255.255.255.252  *                eth0 (10.0.0.2) 0
   10.0.0.4         255.255.255.252  *                eth1 (10.0.0.6) 0

The destination, netmask, gateway, and the interface from the
highlighted entries are indicated on the arrows.

Note that in the OMNeT++ Qtenv GUI you can click on an arrow, and the
corresponding routing table entry will be shown in the inspector window.

Filtering routing table entries
-------------------------------

By default, the best matching routing table entries from all routing
tables towards all destinations are visualized. This visualization can leave the
network cluttered with arrows. It is possible to narrow the selection of
visualized routing tables with filter parameters. The goal of this
section is to demonstrate the use of the :par:`nodeFilter` and
:par:`destinationFilter` parameters.

The section contains two example simulations, which use a more complex
network compared to the simulation in the previous section. The
simulations demonstrate the visualization when it is unfiltered and when
it is filtered. The network looks like the following:

.. figure:: media/filtersnetwork.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

It consists of a router connected to a switch. Two :ned:`StandardHost`'s are
connected to the switch, and two additional :ned:`StandardHost`'s are
connected to the router.

Unfiltered routing table visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example simulation can be run by choosing the ``Unfiltered``
configuration from the ini file. The defaults of the :par:`nodeFilter` and
:par:`destinationFilter` parameters are ``"*"``, which means the best
matching routing entries towards all destinations from all routing
tables are visualized. With the default settings, the network looks like
the following:

.. figure:: media/fullmesh.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

You might have noticed that the arrows don't go through the switch. That
is because L2 devices, such as switches and access points, don't have IP
addresses or routing tables. They are effectively transparent for the
route visualization algorithm. The visualizer could, in theory, know
that the packets will take a path that goes through the switch. However,
in the general case, there may be multiple interconnected switches and
multiple paths that the packets can take, making the visualization a
complicated issue.

Filtered routing table visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example simulation can be run by choosing the ``Filtered``
configuration from the ini file. This example simulation only visualizes
the routes going from ``host2`` to ``host3``. First, the
:par:`destinationFilter` parameter is set to ``host3``. To narrow down the
visualized routes to the ones that lead from ``host2``, the
:par:`nodeFilter` parameter is specified as ``"host2 or host3 or router"``.
(One could also write ``"not(host1 or host4)"`` for the same effect.)
Note that ``router`` needs to be included because the route from
``host2`` to ``host3`` leads through it.

The visualized routing entries look like the following:

.. figure:: media/routes.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

The visualizer's parameters can be changed in the runtime environment,
and the changes take effect immediately. Just select the
:ned:`RoutingTableVisualizer` module, and the parameters are listed in the
inspector panel:

.. figure:: media/parameters.png
   :width: 100%

Visualizing changing routing tables
-----------------------------------

The examples so far have had static routes, but in many scenarios,
routing tables change dynamically. In the following example simulation,
the routing tables are changed by AODV (Advanced On-Demand Vector
Routing Protocol). The simulation can be run by choosing the ``Dynamic``
configuration from the ini file.

The network contains a series of :ned:`AodvRouter`'s. These are mobile hosts
that have AODV and IP forwarding enabled. Six of the hosts are laid out
in a chain and are stationary. Their communication ranges are specified
so that each host can only reach the adjacent hosts. ``destinationHost``
moves up and down along the chain and is only in the communication
range of one or two nearby hosts.

We want the AODV protocol to configure the routing tables, so the
network configurator is instructed not to add static routes.
``sourceHost`` is configured to ping ``destinationHost``. Since each
host is capable of reaching the adjacent hosts only, the ping packets
are relayed to ``destinationHost`` through the chain. As the network
topology changes because of node mobility, the AODV protocol dynamically
configures the routing tables. To reduce clutter, we set the
:par:`destinationFilter` parameter of the visualizer to
``"destinationHost"``.

The following animation depicts what happens when the simulation is run.

.. video:: media/routingtablevisualizer2.mp4
   :width: 100%

When ``destinationHost`` starts to move downwards, packets get routed
along the chain to the host that is currently adjacent to
``destinationHost``. Finally, this host relays the packets to
``destinationHost``. As the node moves, routing tables are kept up to
date by AODV to relay the packets along the chain to
``destinationHost``. On the way back, the lower hosts are not taking
part of the packet relay, and the unused entries remain in their routing
tables for a while, then they time out and are removed. When
``destinationHost`` gets to the top of the scene, the process
starts over again. The visualizer continually reacts to changes in the
routing tables and updates the visualization accordingly.
