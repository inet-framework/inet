Visualizing Statistics
======================

Goals
-----

Although statistical data collected during a simulation is typically analyzed
after the simulation has completed, monitoring statistical data while the
simulation is running can also provide valuable insights into the behavior of
the model. For example, in a video streaming network, observing the throughput
of each client can immediately indicate if the model is performing as expected.

To aid in real-time monitoring, INET supports the visualization of statistics
collected by arbitrary submodules of network nodes, and displayed near the icons
representing the network nodes. This visualization can assist in troubleshooting
and early detection of potential problems in simulation models. The showcase
features two example simulations, demonstrating both basic and advanced features
of the visualization.

About the visualizer
--------------------

The :ned:`StatisticCanvasVisualizer` (included in the network as part of
:ned:`IntegratedCanvasVisualizer`) is capable of displaying a statistic for
multiple network nodes. The visualizer keeps track of the last values of
statistics and displays them next to the icon of the network node.

It subscribes for the signal selected with the :par:`signalName` parameter
and displays the statistic selected with the :par:`statisticName`
parameter. It displays the statistic of modules that match the
expression of the :par:`sourceFilter` parameter, at the network node that
contains the modules. By default, the :par:`statisticName` is the same as
the :par:`signalName`. The :par:`unit` parameter can be used to specify the
unit (or units) to display the statistic in; by default, it is the statistic's unit.

Alternatively, the :par:`statisticExpression` parameter can be used instead of :par:`statisticName`.
The :par:`statisticExpression` parameter can specify an expression with OMNeT++'s ``@statistic`` syntax.
This is useful in case there is no statistic for the required data, or for selecting another statistic recording mode (by default, the first recording mode defined in the statistic is used by :par:`statisticName`).

The :par:`format` parameter is a string that specifies how the visualizer
displays the statistic value. The format string can contain the
following directives:

-  ``%s``: signal name
-  ``%n``: name of statistic
-  ``%v``: value of statistic
-  ``%u``: unit of statistic

The default setting for the format string is ``"%n %v %u"``, i.e. it
displays the statistic name, followed by the value and the unit. The
:par:`unit` parameter selects what unit to display the value in. By
default, it is the unit of the statistic.

Displaying round trip time of ping packets
------------------------------------------

In the first example simulation, a wireless node will ping another
wireless node. We will display the round trip time of ping packets above
source node. The simulation can be run by choosing the ``PingRtt``
configuration from the ini file. The simulation uses the following
simple network:

.. figure:: media/rttnetwork.png
   :width: 40%
   :align: center

The network contains two :ned:`AdhocHost`'s. The hosts are stationary, and
``source`` is configured to ping ``destination``.

The configuration of the visualization in :download:`omnetpp.ini <../omnetpp.ini>` is the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: sourceFilter
   :end-at: unit
   :language: ini

The signal name is set to ``rtt``, and since there is no statistic name
specified, it is also the statistic name. The unit of the statistic is
seconds, but the visualizer is set to display the value in milliseconds.
The :par:`sourceFilter` is not strictly required for this configuration to
work, because the :par:`signalName` parameter is fully specific. The
``rtt`` signal is only emitted by ``pingApp`` modules, so the default
value of :par:`sourceFilter`, which matches all modules, would suffice. The
statistic is only displayed above ``source``, because ``destination``'s
ping application doesn't send any ping packets, thus there is no round
trip time statistic to display.

Displaying packet error rate
----------------------------

In the second example simulation, a wireless node will send UDP packets
to another wireless node as the distance between them increases. We will
display the packet error rate statistic of the received packet at the
receiving node. The simulation can be run by choosing
``PacketErrorRate`` from the ini file. The simulation uses the following
network:

.. figure:: media/pernetwork.png
   :width: 80%

The network contains two :ned:`AdhocHost`'s. One of them, the ``source``, is
stationary, while the ``destination`` is configured to move horizontally
back and forth between its starting position and the right border of the
playground. The ``source`` is configured to send UDP packets to
``destination``.

The visualizer is configured to display the packet error rate statistic
of destination host's ``radio`` module:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: packetSentToUpper
   :end-at: format
   :language: ini

This animation illustrates what happens when the simulation is run:

.. video:: media/statisticvisualizer5.mp4
   :width: 80%

After the first packet exchange, the packet error rate statistic is
displayed above ``destination``. As the simulation progresses,
``destination`` starts moving away from ``source``, while ``source`` is
sending UDP packets to ``destination``. Initially, ``destination``'s
packet error rate statistic is zero, because the hosts are close to each
other, and the transmissions are received correctly. As their distance
increases, the packet error rate begins to grow. It becomes one near the
edge of ``source``'s communication range (displayed as a blue circle). A
packet error rate of one means that no packets are received correctly.
The packet error rate doesn't become one at exactly the communication
range circle, because the circle is an estimation of ``source``'s
communication range. When ``destination`` turns back and gets into the
range again, the packet error rate starts to decrease, reaching zero
when it gets close to ``source``.

documentation.


Try It Yourself
---------------

If you already have INET and OMNeT++ installed, start the IDE by typing
``omnetpp``, import the INET project into the IDE, then navigate to the
``inet/showcases/visualizer/canvas/statistic`` folder in the `Project Explorer`. There, you can view
and edit the showcase files, run simulations, and analyze results.

Otherwise, there is an easy way to install INET and OMNeT++ using `opp_env
<https://omnetpp.org/opp_env>`__, and run the simulation interactively.
Ensure that ``opp_env`` is installed on your system, then execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env run inet-4.5 --init -w inet-workspace --install --build-modes=release --chdir \
       -c 'cd inet-4.5.*/showcases/visualizer/canvas/statistic && inet'

This command creates an ``inet-workspace`` directory, installs the appropriate
versions of INET and OMNeT++ within it, and launches the ``inet`` command in the
showcase directory for interactive simulation.

Alternatively, for a more hands-on experience, you can first set up the
workspace and then open an interactive shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env install --init -w inet-workspace --build-modes=release inet-4.5
    $ cd inet-workspace
    $ opp_env shell

Inside the shell, start the IDE by typing ``omnetpp``, import the INET project,
then start exploring.
