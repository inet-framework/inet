Visualizing Transport Connections
=================================

Goals
-----
In a complex network with many applications and a large number of nodes communicating,
it can be challenging to keep track of all the active transport layer connections.
Transport connection visualization makes it easier to identify the two endpoints
of each connection by displaying a marker above the nodes. The markers appear in
different colors to allow differentiating between connections.

In this showcase, we will present two example simulations that demonstrate the
visualization of TCP connections.

About the visualizer
--------------------

The :ned:`TransportConnectionVisualizer` module (also part of
:ned:`IntegratedVisualizer`) displays color-coded icons above the two
endpoints of an active, established transport layer level connection.
The icons will appear when the connection is established and disappear
when it is closed. Naturally, there can be multiple connections open at
a node, thus there can be multiple icons. Icons have the same color at
both ends of the connection. In addition to colors, letter codes (A, B,
AA, etc.) may also be displayed to help in identifying connections. Note
that this visualizer does not display the paths the packets take. If you
are interested in that, take a look at :ned:`TransportRouteVisualizer`,
covered in the `Visualizing Transport Path
Activity <../transportpathactivity>`__ showcase.

The visualization is turned off by default; it can be turned on by
setting the :par:`displayTransportConnections` parameter of the visualizer
to ``true``.

It is possible to filter the connections being visualized. By default,
all connections are included. Filtering by hosts and port numbers can be
achieved by setting the :par:`sourcePortFilter`, :par:`destinationPortFilter`,
:par:`sourceNodeFilter`, and :par:`destinationNodeFilter` parameters.

The icon, colors, and other visual properties can be configured by
setting the visualizer's parameters.

Enabling the visualization of transport connections
---------------------------------------------------

The first example simulation, configured in the
``EnablingVisualization`` section of the ini file, demonstrates the
visualization with default settings. This example simulation uses the
following network:

.. figure:: media/simplenetwork.png
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

The network contains two :ned:`StandardHost`'s connected to each other, each
containing a TCP application. IP addresses and routing tables are
configured by an :ned:`Ipv4NetworkConfigurator` module. The visualizer
module is a :ned:`TransportConnectionVisualizer`. The application in
``host1`` is configured to open a TCP connection to ``host2`` and send
data to it. The visualization of transport connections is enabled with
the visualizer's :par:`displayTransportConnections` parameter:

.. code-block:: none

   *.visualizer.displayTransportConnections = true

After the simulation is run for a while and the TCP connection is
established, the icons representing the endpoints of the TCP connection
will appear above the hosts. The network will look like the following:

.. figure:: media/simpleconnection.png
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

Multiple transport connections
------------------------------

The following example simulation demonstrates the visualization of
multiple connections and the filtering by node and port number. The
simulation can be run by choosing the ``MultipleConnections``
configuration from the ini file. It uses the following network:

.. figure:: media/complexnetwork.png
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

There are two :ned:`StandardHost`'s connected to a switch, which is
connected via a router to the server, another :ned:`StandardHost`. IP
addresses and routing tables are configured by an
:ned:`Ipv4NetworkConfigurator` module. The visualizer module is an
:ned:`IntegratedVisualizer`.

The hosts are configured to open TCP connections to the server:

-  ``host1``: two connections on port 80 (HTTP), one connection on port
   22 (SSH)
-  ``host2``: one connection on port 80, another one connection on port
   22

The visualizer is instructed to only visualize connections with
the destination port 80:

.. code-block:: none

   *.visualizer.transportConnectionVisualizer.destinationPortFilter = "80"

When the simulation is run, and the connections are established, the
network will look like the following. Note that there are several icons
above ``host1`` and the server, indicating multiple connections.
Endpoints can be matched by color.

.. figure:: media/port80.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

To visualize the connections that use port 22 at the server, the
:par:`destinationPortFilter` should be set to 22. The network will look
like this:

.. figure:: media/port22.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

Additionally, to visualize port 22 connections at ``host2`` only, the
:par:`sourceNodeFilter` parameter should be set to ``host2``. The result
looks like this:

.. figure:: media/port22host2.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

.. todo::

   <!--
   TODO: demonstrate the letters too! A, B, C, AA, AB, etc. "To differentiate connections with the same icon color, capital letters are displayed on the icon."

   To differentiate connections with the same icon color, capital letters are displayed on the icon.
   To demonstrate the letters, the `destinationPortFilter` parameter is set to "`*`" (the default setting) to visualize all three transport connections in the network. Also, the `iconColor` parameter is set to `"blue, red"` to limit the number of used colors to two:
