Visualizing Submodule Information
=================================

Goals
-----

In INET, network nodes are typically composed of multiple submodules, such as
apps, protocols, and protocol parts. These submodules often contain important
information for understanding the behavior of the network, but accessing it can
be difficult, as it requires drilling down into the graphical inspector or
object inspector.

To make this information more accessible, INET provides a feature for displaying
submodule information on the top-level canvas, near the corresponding network
node icons. This makes the information readily available at a glance.

This showcase features a simple WiFi network model and demonstrates how to
display (1) the number of packets sent and received by an application, and (2)
the IEEE 802.11 MAC state information, on the network level.

About the visualizer
--------------------

The :ned:`InfoVisualizer` module (included in the network as part of
:ned:`IntegratedCanvasVisualizer`) can visualize information provided by
submodules one or more levels down in the module hierarchy. This information is
visualized at the submodule of the containing network node, typically at
the top level canvas. The following image illustrates this with the
example of an application that communicates over UDP:

.. figure:: media/example.png
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

The image on the left shows the inside of a host. The text displayed above
the ``app[0]`` submodule indicates the number of packets sent/received by
that application, which can be quite a useful piece of information.
However, to see it, the user has to go into the host, which is especially
inconvenient if there are several such hosts to watch. The image on
the right shows how, with the help of :ned:`InfoVisualizer`, the same
information can be displayed over the host's icon on the top level canvas.

The submodules whose states should be visualized can be selected with
the visualizer's :par:`modules` parameter. This parameter takes full path
module names. Wildcards can be used to select a certain submodule in
multiple nodes. Additionally, one can specify multiple submodules for a
node. By default, the value of the :par:`modules` parameter is ``""`` (no
information displayed.) Also, the visualization can be turned on and off
with the :par:`displayInfos` parameter, which is ``true`` by default.

The visualizer can display module information in various ways, selected
with the :par:`format` parameter. This model takes a format string, which can
contain the following directives:

-  ``%n``: module full name
-  ``%p``: module full path
-  ``%t``: display string text, i.e. the ``t`` tag of the submodule's display string
-  ``%s``: the return value of the module's ``str()`` function

The default format string is ``"%s"``.

On the example image above, the display string text is visualized,
selected with the ``"%t"`` directive.

Example Simulations
-------------------

In the example simulation, three wireless nodes will communicate via
wifi. The network contains three :ned:`AdhocHost`'s arranged in a chain.
The communication ranges of hosts are determined by their radio
transmitter power, which is configured so that hosts can only reach
adjacent hosts in the chain. Hosts' routing tables are set up
accordingly, thus packets going between ``source`` and ``destination``
are routed via ``relay``.
The network also contains an :ned:`Ipv4NetworkConfigurator`, an
:ned:`Ieee80211ScalarRadioMedium`, and an :ned:`IntegratedCanvasVisualizer` module.

Displaying Packet Counts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, we use the visualizer to display the number of packets sent and
received by the UDP application. Thus, for the :par:`modules` parameter,
we specify the ``app[0]`` submodules of the hosts. The :par:`format` parameter
is set to display the submodule's display string text.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: modules = "*.*.app[0]"
   :end-at: placementHint
   :language: ini

To run the simulation, choose the ``PacketCounts`` configuration
from the ini file.

.. figure:: media/packetcounts.png
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

The counts are updated as the simulation progresses.

Displaying MAC State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, we'll visualize the state of the wifi MAC modules:
reception state, transmission state, and contention state.

The IEEE 802.11 MAC is the ``wlan[0].mac`` submodule inside each host.
It is a compound module itself. The transmission process is in its
``tx`` submodule, reception is in its ``rx`` submodule, and
the submodule responsible for contention in DCF mode is the
``dcf.channelAccess.contention`` submodule. All three submodules
display their internal states via display string ``t`` tags
so we can use the :ned:`InfoVisualizer` to display them over
the host icons.

The visualizer allows specifying multiple submodules in the  :par:`modules`
parameter so that we can list all of *tx*, *rx*, and *contention*:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: modules = "*.*.wlan[0].mac.tx
   :end-before: placementHint
   :language: ini

The simulation can be run by choosing the ``MACStates`` configuration
from the ini file. The following captured video shows the result:

.. video:: media/macstates.mp4
   :width: 718
   :height: 480

In the video, you can follow how the MAC states of nodes change as frames are
transmitted and received. For example, when ``source`` starts transmitting
a data frame, its *tx* state switches to ``TRANSMIT``, and when the beginning
of the frame reaches ``relay``, ``relay``'s *rx* state changes to ``BUSY``.

Try It Yourself
---------------

If you already have INET and OMNeT++ installed, start the IDE by typing
``omnetpp``, import the INET project into the IDE, then navigate to the
``inet/showcases/visualizer/canvas/submoduleinfo`` folder in the `Project Explorer`. There, you can view
and edit the showcase files, run simulations, and analyze results.

Otherwise, there is an easy way to install INET and OMNeT++ using `opp_env
<https://omnetpp.org/opp_env>`__, and run the simulation interactively.
Ensure that ``opp_env`` is installed on your system, then execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env run inet-4.5 --init -w inet-workspace --install --build-modes=release --chdir \
       -c 'cd inet-4.5.*/showcases/visualizer/canvas/submoduleinfo && inet'

This command creates an ``inet-workspace`` directory, installs the appropriate
versions of INET and OMNeT++ within it, and launches the ``inet`` command in the
showcase directory for interactive simulation.

Alternatively, for a more hands-on experience, you can first set up the
workspace and then open an interactive shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env install --init -w inet-workspace --build-modes=release inet-4.5
    $ cd inet-workspace
    $ opp_env shell

Inside the shell, start the IDE by typing ``omnetpp``, import the INET project,
then start exploring.
