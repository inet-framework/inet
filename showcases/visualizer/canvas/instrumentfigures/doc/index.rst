Instrument Figures
==================

Goals
-----

In complex simulations, there are usually several statistics that are vital for
understanding what is happening inside the network. While these statistics can
be found in the object inspector panel of Qtenv, they are not always easily
accessible. INET provides a convenient way to display these statistics directly
on the top-level canvas, through the use of instrument figures, which display
various gauges and meters.

This showcase demonstrates the use of multiple instrument figures.

About Instrument Figures
------------------------

Some of the instrument figure types available in INET are the following:

- *gauge:* A circular gauge similar to a speedometer or pressure indicator.

- *linearGauge:* A horizontal linear gauge similar to a VU meter.

- *progressMeter:* A horizontal progress bar.

- *thermometer:* A vertical meter visually similar to a real-life thermometer.

- *indexedImage:* A figure that displays one of several images: the first image for the value 0, the second image for the value of 1, and so on.

- *plot:* An XY chart that plots a statistic in the function of time.

The Network
-----------

The configuration for this showcase demonstrates the use of several
instrument figures. It uses the following network:

.. figure:: media/network3.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

The network contains two :ned:`AdhocHost` nodes, a client and a server.
(The visualizer is only needed to display the server's communication range.)
The scenario is that client connects to the server via WiFi, and downloads a 1-megabyte file.
The client is configured to first move away from the server, eventually
moving out of its transmission range, then to move back.
Both hosts are configured to use WiFi adaptive rate control (:ned:`AarfRateControl`)
so the WiFi transmission bit rate will adapt to the changing channel
conditions, resulting in a varying application level throughput.

The Instruments
---------------

We would like the following statistics to be displayed using instrument figures:

-  Application level throughput should be displayed by a ``gauge`` figure,
   where throughput is averaged over 0.1s or 100 packets;
-  Wifi bit rate determined by automatic rate control should be displayed by a
   ``linearGauge`` figure and a ``plot`` figure;
-  Packet error rate at the client, estimated at the physical layer from signal-to-noise
   ratio, should be displayed by a ``thermometer`` figure and
   a ``plot`` figure;
-  The Wifi MAC channel access contention state of the server should be
   displayed by an ``indexedImage`` figure. IDLE means nothing to send,
   DEFER means the channel is in use, IFS\_AND\_BACKOFF means the channel is
   free and contending to acquire channel;
-  Download progress should be displayed by a ``progressMeter`` figure;
-  The number of socket data transfers to the client application should be
   displayed by a ``counter`` figure.

This is achieved by adding the following lines to the network compound
module:

.. literalinclude:: ../InstrumentShowcase.ned
   :language: ned
   :start-at: @statistic[throughput]
   :end-at: @figure[bitratePlot]

How does that work? Take the first one, ``throughputGauge``, for example.
Instrument figures visualize statistics derived from OMNeT++ signals,
emitted by modules in the network. The ``source`` attribute of
``@statistic[throughput]`` declares that the ``client.app[0]`` module's
``packetReceived`` signal should be taken (it emits the packet object),
and the ``throughput()`` result filter should be applied and divided by
1000000 to get the throughput in Mbps.
Further two attributes, ``record`` and ``targetFigure`` specify that the
resulting values should be sent to the ``throughputGauge`` instrument
figure. The next, ``@figure[throughputGauge]`` line defines the figure
in question. It sets the figure type to ``gauge``, and specifies various
attributes such as position, size, minimum and maximum value, and so on.

Further details:

-  The ``gauge``, ``linearGauge``, and ``thermometer`` figure types have
   :par:`minValue`, :par:`maxValue` and :par:`tickSize` parameters, which can be used to
   customize the range and the granularity of the figures.
-  The ``throughputGauge`` figure's ticks are configured to go from 0 to 25 Mbps in
   5 Mbps increments - the maximum theoretical application level
   throughput of WiFi "g" mode is about 25 Mbps. The application level
   throughput is computed from the received packets at the client,
   using the ``throughput`` result filter.
-  The ``bitrateLinearGauge`` figure's ticks are configured to go from 0 to 54
   Mbps in increments of 6, thus all modes in 802.11g align with ticks,
   e.g. 54, 48, 36, 24 Mbps and so on. The gauge is driven by the
   ``databitrate`` signal, again divided by 1 million to get the values
   in Mbps.
-  The ``perThermometer`` figure displays the packet error rate estimate
   as computed by the client's radio. The ticks go from 0 to 1, in
   increments 0.2. It is driven by the ``packetErrorRate`` signal of the
   client's radio.
-  There are two ``plot`` figures in the network. The ``perPlot`` figure
   displays the packet error rate in the client's radio over time. The
   time window is set to three seconds, so data from the entire
   simulation fit in the graph. The ``bitratePlot`` figure displays the
   WiFi bit rate over time. Its value goes from 0 to 54, and the time
   window is 3 seconds.
-  The ``numRcvdPkCounter`` figure displays the number of data transfers received
   by the client. It takes about 2000 packets to transmit the file, thus
   the number of decimal places to display is set to 4, instead of the
   default 3. It is driven by the ``rcvdPk`` signal of the client's TCP
   app, using the ``count`` result filter to count the packets.
-  The ``progressMeter`` figure is used to display the progress of the file
   transfer. The bytes received by the client's TCP app are summed and
   divided by the total size of the file. The result is multiplied by
   100 to get the value of progress in percent.
-  An ``indexedImage`` figure is used to display the contention state
   of the server's MAC. An image is assigned to each contention state -
   IDLE, DEFER, IFS\_AND\_BACKOFF. The images are specified by the
   figure's ``images`` attribute. Images are listed in the order of the
   contention states as defined in Contention.h file.


Running the Simulation
----------------------

This video illustrates what happens when the simulation is run:

.. video:: media/instruments.mp4
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

The client starts moving away from the server. In the beginning, the
server transmits with a 54 Mbps bit rate. The transmissions are received
correctly because the two nodes are close. As the client moves further
away, the signal to noise ratio drops and packet error rate goes up. As
packet loss increases, the rate control in the server lowers the bit
rate, because lower bit rates are more tolerant to noise. When the
client gets to the edge of the communication range, the bit rate is only
24 Mbps. When it leaves the communication range, successful reception is
impossible, so the rate quickly reaches its lowest. After the client
turns around and re-enters communication range, the rate starts to rise,
eventually reaching 54Mbps again.

The download progress stops when the client is out of range since it is
driven by correctly received packets at the application. Due to the
reliable delivery service of TCP, lost packets are automatically
retransmitted by the server. Thus the progress meter figure measures
progress accurately.

As the rate control changes the wifi bit rate, the application level
throughput changes accordingly. The packet error rate fluctuates as the
rate control switches between higher and lower bit rates back and forth.
The following picture (a zoomed in view of the ``plot1`` figure) clearly
shows these fluctuations. It also shows packet error rate as a function
of distance (due to constant speed).
