In-vehicle Network
==================

Goals
-----

In this example, we demonstrate the combined features of Time-Sensitive Networking
in a complex in-vehicle network. The network utilizes time-aware shaping, automatic
gate scheduling, clock drift, time synchronization, credit-based shaping, per-stream
filtering and policing, stream redundancy, unicast and multicast streams, link
failure protection, frame preemption, and cut-through switching.

The Model
---------

In this showcase, we model the communication network inside a vehicle. The network
consists of several Ethernet switches connected in a redundant way and multiple
end devices. There are several data flows between the end device applications.

Here is the network:

Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini

Standard Ethernet
-----------------

In this configuration, we use only standard Ethernet features to have a baseline
of statistical results.

Time-Sensitive Networking
-------------------------

In this configuration, we use advanced Time-Sensitive Networking features to
evaluate their performance.
