Statistical Policing
====================

Goals
-----

In this example, we combine a sliding window rate meter with a probabilistic packet
dropper to achieve simple statistical policing.

The Model
---------
In this configuration, we use a sliding window rate meter in combination with a
statistical rate limiter. The former measures the throughput by summing up the
packet bytes over the time window, the latter drops packets in a probabilistic
way by comparing the measured data rate to the maximum allowed data rate.
