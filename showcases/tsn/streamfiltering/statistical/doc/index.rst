Statistical Policing
====================

Goals
-----

In this example, we combine a sliding window rate meter with a probabilistic packet
dropper to achieve simple statistical policing.

| Verified with INET version: ``4.4``
| Source files location: `inet/showcases/tsn/streamfiltering/statistical <https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/tree/master/showcases/tsn/streamfiltering/statistical>`__

The Model
---------
In this configuration, we use a sliding window rate meter in combination with a
statistical rate limiter. The former measures the throughput by summing up the
packet bytes over the time window, the latter drops packets in a probabilistic
way by comparing the measured data rate to the maximum allowed data rate.

Try It Yourself
---------------

If you already have INET and OMNeT++ installed, start the IDE by typing
``omnetpp``, import the INET project into the IDE, then navigate to the
``inet/showcases/tsn/streamfiltering/statistical`` folder in the `Project Explorer`. There, you can view
and edit the showcase files, run simulations, and analyze results.

Otherwise, there is an easy way to install INET and OMNeT++ using `opp_env
<https://omnetpp.org/opp_env>`__, and run the simulation interactively.
Ensure that ``opp_env`` is installed on your system, then execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env run inet-4.5 --init -w inet-workspace --install --build-modes=release --chdir \
       -c 'cd inet-4.5.*/showcases/tsn/streamfiltering/statistical && inet'

This command creates an ``inet-workspace`` directory, installs the appropriate
versions of INET and OMNeT++ within it, and launches the ``inet`` command in the
showcase directory for interactive simulation.

Alternatively, for a more hands-on experience, you can first set up the
workspace and then open an interactive shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env install --init -w inet-workspace --build-modes=release inet-4.5
    $ cd inet-workspace
    $ opp_env shell

Inside the shell, start the IDE by typing ``omnetpp``, import the INET project,
then start exploring.
