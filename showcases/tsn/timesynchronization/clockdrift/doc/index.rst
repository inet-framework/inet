Clock Drift
===========

Goals
-----

In the real world, there is no globally agreed-upon time, but each node uses its
own physical clock to keep track of time. Due to finite clock accuracy, the time
of clocks in various nodes of the network may diverge over time. Clock drift
refers to this gradual deviation. To address the issue of clock drift, time
synchronization mechanisms can be used to periodically adjust the clocks of
network devices to ensure that they remain adequately in sync with each other.

The operation of applications and protocols across the network is often very
sensitive to the accuracy of this local time. Time synchronization is important
in TSN, for example, as accurate time-keeping is crucial in these networks.

In this showcase, we will demonstrate how to introduce local clocks in network
nodes and how to configure clock drift for these clocks. We will also show how
to use time synchronization mechanisms to reduce time differences between the
clocks of different devices.

Simulating Clock Drift and Time Synchronization
-----------------------------------------------

By default, modules such as network nodes and interfaces in INET don't have
local time but use the simulation time as a global time. To simulate network
nodes with local time, and effects such as clock drift and its mitigation (time
synchronization), network nodes need to have `clock` submodules. To keep time,
most clock modules use `oscillator` submodules. The oscillators produce ticks
periodically, and the clock modules count the ticks. Clock drift is caused by
inaccurate oscillators. INET provides various oscillator models, so by combining
clock and oscillator models, we can simulate `constant` and `random` clock drift
rates. To model time synchronization, the time of clocks can be set by
`synchronizer` modules.

Several clock models are available:

- :ned:`OscillatorBasedClock`: Has an `oscillator` submodule; keeps time by counting the oscillator's ticks. Depending on the oscillator submodule, can model `constant` and `random clock drift rate`
- :ned:`SettableClock`: Same as the oscillator-based clock but the time can be set from C++ or a scenario manager script
- :ned:`IdealClock`: The clock's time is the same as the simulation time; for testing purposes

The following oscillator models are available:

- :ned:`IdealOscillator`: generates ticks periodically with a constant tick length
- :ned:`ConstantDriftOscillator`: generates ticks periodically with a constant drift rate in generation speed; for modeling `constant rate clock drift`
- :ned:`RandomDriftOscillator`: the oscillator changes drift rate over time; for modeling `random clock drift`

Synchronizers are implemented as application-layer modules. For clock synchronization, the synchronizer 
modules need to set the time of clocks, thus only the SettableClock supports synchronization. 
The following synchronizer modules are available:

- :ned:`SimpleClockSynchronizer`: Uses an out-of-band mechanism to synchronize clocks, instead of a real clock synchronization protocol. Useful for simulations where the details of time synchronization are not important.
- :ned:`Gptp`: Uses the General Precision Time Protocol to synchronize clocks.

The :ned:`SimpleClockSynchronizer` module periodically synchronizes a slave
clock to a master clock. The synchronization interval can be configured with a
parameter. Also, in order to model real-life synchronization protocols, which
are somewhat inaccurate by nature, the accuracy can be specified (see the NED
documentation of the module for more details).

The General Precision Time Protocol (gPTP, or IEEE 802.1 AS) can synchronize
clocks in an Ethernet network with a high clock accuracy required by TSN
protocols. It is implemented in INET by the :ned:`Gptp` module. Several network
node types, such as :ned:`EthernetSwitch` have optional gPTP modules, activated
by the :par:`hasGptp` boolean parameter. It can also be inserted into hosts as
one of the applications. Gptp is demonstrated in the last example of this
showcase. For more details about :ned:`Gptp`, check out the
:doc:`/showcases/tsn/timesynchronization/gptp/doc/index` showcase or the
module's NED documentation.

When synchronization happens, both synchronizers update the current time of the
clocks. Additionally, they update the drift rate of the clocks as well, by
setting the oscillator compensation. :ned:`SimpleClockSynchronizer` reads
the actual clock drift rate with an out-of-band mechanism, and sets the
oscillator compensation accordingly. With :ned:`Gptp`, the oscillator
compensation is set based on the last two time synchronization events.

The Model and Results
---------------------

The showcase contains several example simulations. All simulations use the following network:

.. figure:: media/Network2.png
   :align: center

The example configurations are the following:

- ``NoClockDrift``: Network nodes don't have clocks, they are synchronized by simulation time
- ``ConstantClockDrift``: Network nodes have clocks with constant clock drift rate, and the clocks diverge over time
- ``ConstantClockDriftOutOfBandSync``: Clocks have a constant drift rate, and they are synchronized by an out-of-band synchronization method (without a real protocol)
- ``RandomClockDrift``: Clocks have a periodically changing random clock drift rate
- ``RandomClockDriftOutOfBandSync``: Clocks have a periodically changing random clock drift rate, and they are synchronized by an out-of-band synchronization method (without a real protocol)
- ``RandomClockDriftGptpSync``: Clocks have random a periodically changing random clock drift rate, and they are synchronized by gPTP

In the ``General`` configuration, ``source1`` is configured to send UDP packets to ``sink1``, and ``source2`` to ``sink2``.

.. note:: To demonstrate the effects of drifting clocks on the network traffic, we configure the Ethernet MAC layer in ``switch1`` to alternate between forwarding frames from ``source1`` and ``source2`` every 10 us, by using a TSN gating mechanism in ``switch1``. This does not affect the simulation results in the next few sections but becomes important in the `Effects of Clock Drift on End-to-end Delay` section. More details about this part of the configuration are provided there.

In the next few sections, we present the above examples. In the simulations
featuring constant clock drift, ``switch1`` always has the same clock drift
rate. In the random drift configurations, the drift rate is specified with the
same distribution, but the actual drift rates can differ between configurations.
In the configurations also featuring clock synchronization, the hosts are
synchronized to the time of ``switch1``. We plot the time difference of clocks
and simulation time to see how the clocks diverge from the simulation time and
each other. 

Example: No Clock Drift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, network nodes don't have clocks. Applications and gate
schedules are synchronized by simulation time. (End-to-end delays in the other 
three cases will be compared to this baseline configuration.)

There are no clocks, so the configuration is empty:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: NoClockDrift
   :end-before: ConstantClockDrift

Example: Constant Clock Drift Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, all network nodes have a clock with a constant drift rate.
Clocks drift away from each other over time.

Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: ConstantClockDrift
   :end-before: RandomClockDrift

We configure the network nodes to have :ned:`OscillatorBasedClock` modules, with
a :ned:`ConstantDriftOscillator`. We also set the drift rate of the oscillators.
By setting different drift rates for the different clocks, we can control how
they diverge over time. Note that the drift rate is defined as compared to
simulation time. Also, we need to explicitly tell the relevant modules (here,
the UDP apps and ``switch1``'s queue) to use the clock module in the host,
otherwise, they would use the global simulation time by default.

Here are the drifts (time differences) over time:

.. figure:: media/ConstantClockDrift.png
   :align: center

The three clocks have different drift rates. The magnitude and direction of
drift of ``source1`` and ``source2`` compared to ``switch1`` are different as
well, i.e. ``source1``'s clock is early and ``source2``'s clock is late compared
to ``switch1``'s.

.. note:: A `clock time difference to the simulation time` chart can be easily produced by plotting the ``timeChanged:vector`` statistic and applying a linear trend operation with -1 as the argument.

Example: Out-of-Band Synchronization of Clocks, Constant Drift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, the network node clocks have the same constant drift rate
as in the previous configuration, but they are periodically synchronized by an
out-of-band mechanism (C++ function call).

The out-of-band synchronization settings are defined in a base configuration, ``OutOfBandSyncBase``, that we can extend:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: OutOfBandSyncBase
   :end-before: ConstantClockDriftOutOfBandSync

Since we want to use clock synchronization, we need to be able to set the
clocks, so network nodes have :ned:`SettableClock` modules. The
``defaultOverdueClockEventHandlingMode = "execute"`` setting means that when
setting the clock forward, events that become overdue are done immediately. We
use the :ned:`SimpleClockSynchronizer` for out-of-band synchronization.
Synchronizer modules are implemented as applications, so we add one to each
source host in an application slot. We set the synchronizer modules to sync time
to the clock of ``switch1``. We specify a small random clock time error for the
synchronization, thus the clock times will not be synchronized perfectly.

For the constant clock drift rate, this configuration extends
``ConstantClockDrift``. For the synchronization, it extends
``OutOfBandSyncBase`` as well. Otherwise, the configuration is empty:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: ConstantClockDriftOutOfBandSync
   :end-before: RandomClockDriftOutOfBandSync

Let's see the time differences:

.. figure:: media/OutOfBandSyncConstant.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

The clock of ``switch1`` has a constant drift rate compared to simulation time.
Since the clock drift rate in all clocks is constant, the drift rate differences
are compensated for after the first synchronization event by setting the
oscillator compensation in the synchronized clocks. After that, all
clocks have the same drift rate as the clock of ``switch1``. Let's zoom in on
the beginning of the above chart:

.. figure:: media/OutOfBandSyncConstantZoomed.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

At the beginning of the simulation, the clocks have a different drift rate,
until the drift rate is compensated for at the first synchronization event. The
drift rate is compensated for with no error, but time is synchronized with a
small random error we configured (note the small distance between the lines
after synchronization, which randomly varies at each sync event).

Example: Random Clock Drift Rate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, clocks utilize the :ned:`RandomDriftOscillator` module,
which periodically changes the drift rate through a random walk process. The
magnitude of drift rate change is specified as a distinct distribution for each
oscillator. Additionally, the interval of drift rate change is set to be
constant. Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: RandomClockDrift
   :end-before: OutOfBandSyncBase

The following chart displays how the clocks diverge over time:

.. figure:: media/RandomClockDrift.png
   :align: center

Example: Out-of-Band Synchronization of Clocks, Random Drift
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This configuration extends the previous one with a periodic out-of-band
synchronization mechanism (using cross-network node C++ function calls), defined
in the ``OutOfBandSyncBase`` configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: RandomClockDriftOutOfBandSync
   :end-before: RandomClockDriftGptpSync

As with the constant drift rate + out-of-band synchronization case, 
we specify a small random clock time synchronization error, but no
drift rate synchronization error.

.. figure:: media/OutOfBandSyncRandom.png
   :align: center

The clock of ``switch1`` keeps drifting, but the clocks of the sources are
synchronized to it. Here is the same chart, but zoomed in:

.. figure:: media/OutOfBandSyncRandomZoomed.png
   :align: center

The rate of clock drift is perfectly synchronized, so the lines for the sources
are tangential to ``switch1``'s at the synchronization points. However, the
clocks drift between synchronization events, so the divergence increases until
synchronized again.

Example: Synchronizing Clocks Using gPTP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, the clocks in network nodes have the same drift rates as
in the previous two configurations, but they are periodically synchronized to a
master clock using the Generic Precision Time Protocol (gPTP). The protocol
measures the delay of individual links and disseminates the clock time of the
master clock on the network through a spanning tree.

Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: RandomClockDriftGptpSync

Here are the time differences:

.. figure:: media/GptpSync.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

The clock of ``switch1`` has a periodically changing random drift rate, and the
other clocks periodically synchronize to ``switch1``.

Here is the above chart zoomed in:

.. figure:: media/GptpSyncZoomed.png
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

The drift rate difference, calculated from the previous two synchronization
events, is used to set the oscillator compensation.

Accuracy of Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The precision of time synchronization can be visualized by zooming in on the
above clock time charts. We can examine the moment when the times of the source
hosts change. The distance of the new time from the reference shows the
precision in time synchronization:

.. figure:: media/gptp_time_accuracy.png
   :align: center

When the clocks are synchronized, the drift rate differences are also
compensated for by setting the oscillator compensation in clocks. We can
observe this on the following zoomed-in image:

.. figure:: media/GptpSync_RateAccuracy.png
   :align: center

Synchronization makes the lines more parallel, i.e. drift rates more closely
match each other. Also, note that the drift rate sometimes changes between
synchronization events due to the random walk process.

We configured a time synchronization error with a random distribution for the
SimpleClockSynchronizer, but no drift rate compensation errors. In the case of
gPTP, the accuracy is not settable but an emergent property of the protocol's
operation. Also, gPTP synchronization inherently has some drift rate
compensation errors.

.. note:: - When configuring the :ned:`SimpleClockSynchronizer` with a :par:`synchronizationClockTimeError` of 0, the synchronized time perfectly matches the reference.
   - When configuring the :ned:`SimpleClockSynchronizer` with a :par:`synchronizationOscillatorCompensationError` of 0, the compensated clock drift rate perfectly matches the reference. Otherwise, the error can be specified in PPM.
   - When using any of the synchronization methods, the clock time difference between the clocks is very small, in the order of microseconds.

Effects of Clock Drift on End-to-end Delay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section aims to demonstrate that clock drift can have profound effects on
the operation of the network. We take a look at the end-to-end delay in the four
examples to show this effect. 

To this end, in all simulations, the Ethernet MAC layer in ``switch1`` is
configured to alternate forwarding packets from ``source1`` and ``source2``
every 10 us; note that the UDP applications are sending packets every 20 us,
with packets from ``source2`` offset by 10 us compared to ``source1``. Thus
packets from both sources have a send window in ``switch1``, and the sources
generate and send packets to ``switch1`` in sync with that send window (they are
only in sync if the clocks in the nodes are in sync, as we'll see later).

Here is how we configure this. We configure the EthernetMacLayer in ``switch1``
to contain a GatingPriorityQueue, with two inner queues: 

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: GatingPriorityQueue
   :end-at: numQueues
   :language: ini

The inner queues in the GatingPriorityQueue each have their own gate. The gates
connect to a PriorityScheduler, so the gating priority queue prioritizes packets
from the first inner queue. Here is a gating priority queue with two inner
queues:

.. figure:: media/GatingPriorityQueue.png
   :align: center

In our case, we configure the classifier (set to ContentBasedClassifier) to send
packets from ``source1`` to the first queue and those from source2 to the
second, thus the gating priority queue prioritizes packets from ``source1``. The
gates are configured to open and close every 10us, with the second gate offset
by a 10us period (so they alternate being open). Furthermore, we align the gate
schedules with the traffic generation by offsetting both gate schedules with
3.118us, the time it takes for a packet to be transmitted from a source to
``switch1``. Here is the rest of the gating priority queue configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: ContentBasedClassifier
   :end-before: NoClockDrift
   :language: ini

.. **TODO** traffic config

As mentioned before, the traffic applications in the sources generate packets
every 20us, with ``source2`` offset from ``source1`` by 10us:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: source applications
   :end-at: localPort
   :language: ini

.. **TODO** only one packet per send window

Note that only one data packet fits into the send window. However, gPTP packets are small
and are sent in the same send windows as data packets.

We measure the end-to-end delay of packets from the source applications to
the corresponding sink applications. Let's examine the results below.

.. First, we take a look at the out-of-band synchronization cases. The delay in the
.. case of no clock drift is constant, and the value is displayed on the charts as
.. a baseline.

First, we take a look at the out-of-band synchronization cases. In the case of
no clock drift, packet generation is perfectly aligned in time with gate
schedules, thus packets always find the gates open. End-to-end delay is
constant, as it stems from transmission time only (no queuing delay due to
closed gates). This delay value is displayed on the charts as a baseline:

.. figure:: media/delay_outofbandsync.png
   :align: center

   .. At the beginning of the simulation, the delay is large because the drift rate
   .. difference between the clocks is not yet synchronized. After that, however, the
   .. delay is lower and bounded. The following chart shows the same data zoomed in: **TODO** not anymore -> actually, the constant blue is large

At the beginning of the simulation, the delay for constant drift/sink1 is large because the drift rate
difference between the clocks is not yet synchronized. After that, however, its delay is lower and bounded.
The delay in the random case fluctuates more than the constant case. However, both the constant and the random
cases have periods where the delay is at the baseline level.

.. **TODO** not sure the first one is needed

.. note:: Traffic generation and gate opening and closing times don't need to be perfectly in sync for the data points to be at the baseline,
          because the gates are open for 10us, and a packet transmission takes ~6.4us.

The following chart shows the same data zoomed in:

.. figure:: media/delay_outofbandsync_zoomed.png
   :align: center

In the case of the constant clock drift, the drift rate difference is
compensated perfectly at the first synchronization event, thus the line sections
are completely horizontal. However, we specified a random error for the time
difference synchronization, thus the values change at every synchronization
event, every 0.5ms.

In the case of the random clock drift, the drift rate is compensated with no
error at every synchronization event, but the drift rate of the clocks keeps
changing randomly even between synchronization events. This results in
fluctuating delay.

Let's see the case where a random clock drift rate oscillator is used with gPTP:

.. figure:: media/delay_gptp.png
   :align: center

The delay distribution is similar to the out-of-band synchronization case, but
there are outliers. gPTP needs to send packets over the network for time
synchronization, as opposed to using an out-of-band mechanism. These gPTP
messages can sometimes cause delays for packets from ``source1``, causing them
to wait in the queue.

.. note:: The outliers can be eliminated by giving gPTP packets priority over the source application packets. Ideally, they can have allocated time in the gate schedule as well.

The following chart displays out-of-band synchronization and gPTP, so they can be compared:

.. figure:: media/delay_outofbandsync_gptp.png
   :align: center

In all these cases, the applications send packets in sync with the opening of
the gates in the queue in ``switch1``. In the no clock drift case, the delay
depends only on the bit rate and packet length. In the case of
``OutOfBandSynchronization`` and ``GptpSynchronization``, the clocks drift but
the drift is periodically eliminated by synchronization, so the delay remains
bounded.

Let's see what happens to delay when there is no synchronization:

.. figure:: media/delay_constant.png
   :align: center

The delay keeps changing substantially compared to the other cases.

What's the reason behind these graphs? When there is no clock drift (or it is
eliminated by synchronization), the end-to-end delay is bounded because the
packets are generated in the sources in sync with the opening of the
corresponding gates in ``switch1`` (the send windows). In the constant clock
drift case, the delay's characteristics depend on the magnitude and direction of
the drift between the clocks.

It might be helpful to think of the constant drift rate as time dilation. In
ideal conditions (no clock drift or eliminated clock drift), the clocks in all
three modules keep the same time, so there is no time dilation. The packets in
both sources are generated in sync with the send windows (when the corresponding
gate is open), and they are forwarded immediately by ``switch1``. In the
constant clock drift case, from the point of view of ``switch1``, the clock of
``source1`` is slower than its own, and the clock of ``source2`` is faster.
Thus, the packet stream from ``source1`` is sparser than in the ideal case, and
the packet stream from ``source2`` is denser, due to time dilation.

If the packet stream is sparser (orange graph), there are on average fewer
packets to send than the number of send windows in a given amount of time, so
packets don't accumulate in the queue. However, due to the drifting clocks, the
packet generation and the send windows are not in sync anymore but keep
shifting. Sometimes a packet arrives at the queue in ``switch1`` when the
corresponding gate is closed, so it has to wait for the next opening. This next
opening happens earlier and earlier for subsequent packets (due to the relative
direction of the drift in the two clocks), so packets wait less and less in the
queue, hence the decreasing part of the curve. Then the curve becomes
horizontal, meaning that the packets arrive when the gate is open and they can
be sent immediately. After some time, the gate opening shifts again compared to
the packet generation, so the packets arrive just after the gate is closed, and
they have to wait for a full cycle in the queue before being sent. 

If the packet stream is denser (blue graph), there are more packets to send on
average than the number of send windows in a given amount of time, so packets
eventually accumulate in the queue. This causes the delay to keep increasing
indefinitely.

.. note:: - The packets are not forwarded by ``switch1`` if the transmission wouldn't finish before the gate closes (a packet takes 6.4us to transmit, the gate is open for 10us).
          - The length of the horizontal part of the orange graph is equal to how much the two clocks drift during the time of ``txWindow - txDuration``. In the case of the orange graph, it is ``(10us - 6.4us) / 700ppm ~= 5ms``

.. - The length of the horizontal part of the orange graph is equal to how much the two clocks drift during kets to send than the number of send windows in a given amount of time, so packets don’t accumulate in the queue. However, due to the drifting clocks, the packet generation and the send windows are not in sync anymore but keep shifting. Sometimes a packet arrives at the queue in switch1 when the corresponding gate is closed, so it has to wait for the next opening. This next opening happens earlier and earlier for subsequent packets (due to the relative direction of the drift in the two clocks), so packets wt is ``(10us - 6.4us) / 700ppm ~= 5ms``

Thus, if constant clock drift is not eliminated, the network can no longer
guarantee any bounded delay for the packets. The constant clock drift has a
predictable repeated pattern but still has a significant effect on delay. 

Let's examine the random clock drift case:

.. figure:: media/delay_random.png
   :align: center

Unpredictable random clock drift might have an even larger impact on delay.

The following chart compares the constant and random clock drift rate cases:

.. figure:: media/delay_constant_random.png
   :align: center

The clocks in the similar plots (e.g., constant drift/sink1 and random
drift/sink2) drift in the same direction.
