Time Synchronization
====================

Time synchronization aims to coordinate otherwise independent clocks. Even when
initially set accurately, real clocks are going to differ after some amount of
time. This is caused by clocks counting time at slightly different rates called
clock drift.

The following showcases demonstrate topics related to time synchronization:
