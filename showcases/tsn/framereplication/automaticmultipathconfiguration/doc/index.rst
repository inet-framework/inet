Automatic Multipath Stream Configuration
========================================

Goals
-----

In this example, we demonstrate the automatic stream redundancy configuration based
on multiple paths from the source to the destination.

| INET version: ``4.4``
| Source files location: `inet/showcases/tsn/framereplication/automaticmultipathconfiguration <https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/tree/master/showcases/tsn/framereplication/automaticmultipathconfiguration>`__

The Model
---------

In this case, we use an automatic stream redundancy configurator that takes the
different paths for each redundant stream as an argument. The automatic configurator
sets the parameters of all stream identification, stream merging, stream splitting,
string encoding, and stream decoding components of all network nodes.

Here is the network:

.. figure:: media/Network.png
   :align: center

Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini

Results
-------

Here are the number of received and sent packets:

Here is the ratio of received and sent packets:

   :align: center

The expected number of successfully received packets relative to the number of
sent packets is verified by the python scripts. The expected result is around 0.657.
