Manual Stream Configuration
===========================

Goals
-----

In this example, we demonstrate manual configuration of stream identification,
stream splitting, stream merging, stream encoding, and stream decoding to achieve
the desired stream redundancy.

The Model
---------

In this configuration, we replicate a network topology that is presented in the
IEEE 802.1 CB amendment. The network contains one source and one destination node,
where the source sends a redundant data stream through five switches. The stream
is duplicated in three of the switches and merged in two of them.

Here is the network:

Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini

Results
-------

Here are the number of received and sent packets:

   :width: 100%

Here is the ratio of received and sent packets:

   :align: center

The expected number of successfully received packets relative to the number of
sent packets is verified by the Python scripts. The expected result is around 0.657.
