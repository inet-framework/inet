Time-Sensitive Networking
=========================

Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) refers to a set of IEEE 802 standards that make
Ethernet deterministic by default. The TSN extensions in particular address the
transmission with bounded low latency and high availability. Applications include
converged networks with real-time audio/video streaming and real-time control
streams which are used in automotive or industrial control facilities.
