Automatic Gate Schedule Configuration
=====================================

In time-aware shaping, gate schedules (i.e. when the gates corresponding to different traffic categories are open or closed) can be specified manually. This might be sufficient in some simple cases.
However, in complex cases, manual calculation of gate schedules may be impossible, thus automation may be required. Gate schedule configurators can be used for this purpose.

One needs to specify constraints for the different traffic categories, such as maximum delay,
and the configurator automatically calculates and configures the gate schedules that satisfy
these constraints.

Currently, INET contains three gate scheduling configurator models:

- :ned:`EagerGateScheduleConfigurator`: This is a simple model, which eagerly allocates the gate schedule. It can fail even in cases where a solution exists.
- :ned:`Z3GateScheduleConfigurator`: This uses a SAT-solver-based method to find solutions that satisfy the latency and jitter requirements.
- :ned:`TSNschedGateScheduleConfigurator`: This uses an external tool instead of the built-in functionality.

The following showcases demonstrate gate scheduling for time-aware shaping:
