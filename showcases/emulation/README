The CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege is required for using network namespaces in INET.
Changing the network namespace requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN authority for the
'setns()' function in the 'inet::NetworkNamespaceContext' constructor.
The next commands add this privilege to opp_run, so that all simulations run with this privilege.
This is dangerous because it enables several admin capabilities for all
running simulations, and it becomes a security hole (for more details, see CAP_SYS_ADMIN linux man pages; run command $> man 7 capabilities). Make sure to remove the
privilege after you're finished using network namespaces.

Run the following commands to add the CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege to opp_run:

$> sudo setcap cap_sys_admin+ep /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_release
$> sudo setcap cap_sys_admin+ep /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_dbg

To remove extra privileges after you're finished using network namespaces, use the following commands:

$> sudo setcap -r /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_release
$> sudo setcap -r /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_dbg

Some Linux systems (Ubuntu 24.04 for example) use AppArmor for fine grained access control.
On systems with AppArmor you need additional configuration to make the certain emulation showcases work:

You can copy the provided opp_run AppArmor profile to the system profiles folder:

$> sudo cp opp_run /etc/apparmor.d

Then enforce and disable the new opp_run AppArmor profile in order to put opp_run_* executables into unconfined mode:

$> sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/opp_run
$> sudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/opp_run

You can build a more specific profile which only allows what is needed by the emulation showcases.
Such a profile is not provided for INET, see the opp_run.off profile for hints.
