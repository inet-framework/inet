Using Simulated Applications in a Real Network
==============================================

Goals
-----

This showcase demonstrates how a simulated application can function as a real
application and communicate over a real network. This opens up a range of
possibilities, such as testing the behavior of a simulation model over a real
network, or evaluating its interoperability with real-world implementations of
the same application.

The goal is achieved by utilizing the INET application-layer module within a
"wrapper" simulation. In this simulation, (1) we map INET sockets to the real sockets
of the host operating system (OS), thus allowing application traffic to go
through the network stack of the host OS, and (2) we employ a real-time event
scheduler to ensure that timings align with real time.

As an example, the demonstration uses a Voice over IP (VoIP) application. The
sender and receiver applications run in separate simulations in real time, and
send realistic VoIP traffic (contents of an audio file) over the host network.
The received audio is saved to a file, which can be compared to the original to
assess the impact of network transmission on audio quality.

Please note that the ``VoipStream`` and ``NetworkEmulationSupport`` features of the INET
Framework must be enabled for this demonstration (they are disabled by default),
and it is only compatible with Linux systems.

Introduction
------------

Let's see a bit of background first. INET contains several components to allow a
variety of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation scenarios. Specifically, it
contains one or two additional variants for several protocols and interfaces: an
"ext lower" and/or an "ext upper" variant. The naming indicates that the given
"half" of the protocol or interface connects to something external to the
simulation, namely to an interface or socket on the host OS. This showcase
demonstrates how such modules make it possible to build HIL scenarios like real
apps/devices in a simulated network, or simulated apps/devices in a real
network.

In this showcase, we'll use :ned:`ExtLowerUdp`. This is a module that looks like
a normal UDP module to its higher layers (i.e. applications), but in fact it
sends and receives real UDP packets via the network stack of the host OS. In our
simulation, we'll let a pair of VoIP applications that normally use the
:ned:`Udp` module communicate over :ned:`ExtLowerUdp`, and we'll make the actual
UDP packets travel across a real network so that we can see how that affects
voice quality. The simulations will be run under a real-time event scheduler
(``inet::RealTimeScheduler``), so that timings correspond to real time.

Note that the division of the simulated and real parts of the network is
arbitrary; INET has support for dividing the network at other levels of the
protocol stack; for example, at the link layer.

The Simulation Setup
--------------------

The following figure illustrates the simulation setup:

.. figure:: media/setup.png
   :align: center
   :width: 40%

We'll use the :ned:`VoipStreamSender` and :ned:`VoipStreamReceiver` modules to
generate the realistic VoIP traffic, and :ned:`ExtLowerUdp` modules to connect
the applications to the real network. These modules are the only ones we need,
so the following "network" will suffice:

.. literalinclude:: ../AppContainer.ned
   :language: ned
   :start-at: network AppContainer

We'll configure the ``app`` submodule to have type :ned:`VoipStreamSender` and
:ned:`VoipStreamReceiver` on the sender and the receiver side, respectively.
Both networks look like the following when run under Qtenv:

.. image:: media/VoipStreamSenderApplication.png
   :width: 25%
   :align: center

.. note:: The ``AppContainer`` module used in this showcase is quite generic. It can
   turn any (UDP-only) simulated application into a real-life application that
   communicates over the network stack of the host OS.

Operation
~~~~~~~~~

When we run the simulations, :ned:`VoipStreamSender` in the sender-side
simulation process will generate VoIP packets and send them to its
:ned:`ExtLowerUdp` module. :ned:`ExtLowerUdp` maintains a real UDP socket in the
host OS, so the packets it receives from the application will be sent in real
UDP packets over the protocol stack of the host OS.

The UDP packets will then travel through the real network, and find their way to
the node which runs the receiver-side simulation process. The packets will be
received by the real UDP socket that :ned:`ExtLowerUdp` maintains there, converted to
simulation packets, then sent up to the :ned:`VoipStreamReceiver` module. The
:ned:`VoipStreamReceiver` module receives and decodes them, and creates an audio
file at the end of the simulation.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the simulation, only a sender node and a receiver node are needed in order to
send the packets into the real network on one side and receive them on
the other side. The two simulated nodes are in separate parts of the whole
network, so they are defined in separate networks in the NED file, and run in
separate simulations.

The :ned:`ExtLowerUdp` module behaves just like the :ned:`Udp` module from the point of view
of the modules above them. In this showcase (aside from assigning the :ned:`ExtLowerUdp`
modules to network namespaces) only the VoIP modules need to be configured.
The simulations are defined in separate configurations of :download:`omnetpp.ini <../omnetpp.ini>`.

- The :ned:`VoipStreamSender` module transmits the contents of an audio file
  as VoIP traffic. The module resamples the audio, encodes it with a codec,
  chops it into packets and sends the packets via UDP. By default, it creates
  packets containing 20 ms of audio, and sends a packet every 20 ms.
  The codec, the sample rate, the time length of the audio packets, and other
  settings can be specified by parameters.

- The :ned:`VoipStreamReceiver` module can receive this data stream, decode it
  and save it as an audio file. The module numbers the incoming packets, and discards
  out-of-order ones. There is a playout delay (specified by parameter; by default 20 ms)
  simulating a de-jitter buffer.

The :ned:`VoipStreamSender` and :ned:`VoipStreamReceiver` modules are configured
just like they would be in a fully simulated scenario, no special configuration
is needed. Here is the relevant configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :end-before: VoipSenderLoopback

Running
-------

This section presents various configurations for running the VoIP simulation.
It includes a setup for running the experiment over a real network, and
various configurations for running it in a virtual network on the local computer.

.. note:: A different showcase (:doc:`mininet`) is dedicated to showing the use of
   Mininet for setting up the virtual network.

Over a Real Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To try this showcase over a real network, you need to install the simulation on
two different machines. When it is done:

First, run the following command on the receiver side:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ inet -u Cmdenv voipreceiver.ini

Once the receiver is running, enter the following command on the sender side
(replace ``10.0.0.8`` with the IP address of the host the receiver side is
running on):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ inet -u Cmdenv voipsender.ini '--*.app.destAddress="10.0.0.8"'

That's all. When the receiver-side simulation exits, you'll find the received
audio file in ``results/received.wav``. You may need to raise the CPU time limit
in the receiver-side simulation so that it does not exit prematurely.

Using the Loopback Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, both simulations run on the same host, and packets will
go via the loopback interface. Each sent packet goes down the protocol stack,
through the loopback interface, and back up the protocol stack into the other
simulation process.

The setup for the loopback interface case is illustrated by the following
figure:

.. figure:: media/setup2.png
   :align: center
   :width: 40%

You can run this scenario in the same way as the previous one, just specify
``127.0.0.1`` for destination address.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ inet -u Cmdenv voipreceiver.ini &
   $ inet -u Cmdenv voipsender.ini '--*.app.destAddress="127.0.0.1"'

Loopback Interface with Realistic Network Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Linux kernel allows us to apply delay, jitter, packet loss and data
corruption to the packets traveling through the loopback interface. We can use
this feature to simulate the effects of the packets going through a real
network.

To try it, issue the following command before running the simulations. The
command adds some delay (10ms with 1ms random variation), packet loss and data
corruption to the traffic passing through the loopback interface:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem loss 1% corrupt 5% delay 10ms 1ms

When you are done with the experiments, run the following command to restore the
loopback interface to its original state:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo tc qdisc del dev lo root

Alternatively, you can use the provided :download:`run_loopback<../run_loopback>`
script that automates the above procedure.

Using Virtual Ethernet Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This configuration uses network namespaces and virtual Ethernet interfaces,
which are features provided by the Linux kernel. A network namespace provides a
complete virtualized network stack independent from the main network stack of
the host OS.

We'll create two namespaces, ``net0`` and ``net1``. Then we'll create a virtual
Ethernet interface in both, and name them ``veth0`` and ``veth1``. The two
interfaces will be connected to each other. This setup is illustrated below:

.. figure:: media/setup3.png
   :align: center
   :width: 40%

It can be produced with the following lengthy sequence of commands that
needs to be run as *root*:

.. literalinclude:: ../veth_setup
   :language: bash
   :start-at: create namespaces

The commands create the two namespaces, and a *veth* interface in each. Then
they add routes; a route for both direction is required because even though VoIP
traffic uses only one direction, there is an ARP exchange at the beginning. Note
that the *veth* interfaces are created in pairs, and are automatically connected
to each other. The last command adds some some delay, packet loss and corruption
to the ``veth0`` interface like we did in the loopback-based setup.

In the simulation configurations, we need to tell the :ned:`ExtLowerUdp` modules
to use the ``net0`` / ``net1`` namespaces, and set the sender's ``destAddress``
parameter to ``192.168.2.2``.

In ``voipsender.ini``:

.. literalinclude:: ../voipsender.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: VirtualEth
   :end-at: net0

In ``voipreceiver.ini``:

.. literalinclude:: ../voipreceiver.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: VirtualEth
   :end-at: net1

You can run the simulations with the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ inet -s -u Cmdenv voipreceiver.ini -c VirtualEth &
   $ inet -s -u Cmdenv voipsender.ini -c VirtualEth

When you are finished, you can remove the virtual Ethernet interfaces by
deleting the namespaces with the following commands (also to be run as *root*):

.. literalinclude:: ../veth_teardown
   :language: bash
   :start-after: remove the namespaces

If you don't want to enter the setup and teardown commands manually, you can use
the provided :download:`veth_setup<../veth_setup>` and
:download:`veth_teardown<../veth_teardown>` scripts (with ``sudo``), or use
:download:`run_veth<../run_veth>` that automates the complete procedure.

Results
-------

Let's look at results obtained from running the loopback-based configuration
with a lossy link. As a reference, you can listen to the original audio file by
clicking the play button below:

.. raw:: html

   <p><audio controls> <source src="media/Beatify_Dabei_cut.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio tag.</audio></p>

Here is the received audio file:

.. raw:: html

   <p><audio controls> <source src="media/received.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio tag.</audio></p>

The quality of the received sound is degraded compared to the original. The sender creates
and sends audio packets every 20ms, but when they go through the host OS
protocol stack, the packets are sent in bursts, as illustrated by the following image.
The image displays the time for packets sent by the sender (left) and packets received
by the receiver (right):

.. figure:: media/log.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

The traffic becomes bursty before the delay and jitter are applied.
The time difference between the packets in a burst is smaller than the applied jitter,
so that some of the packets are reordered. The receiver drops out-of-order packets,
thus the audio quality suffers.

Without the jitter, the packets would still arrive in bursts, but not reordered.
The quality would be nearly as good as the original file. (To reduce burstiness
and keep the packet order, a data rate can be specified in the ``netem`` command,
e.g. ``rate 1000kbps``. This eliminates reordering in this scenario.)
