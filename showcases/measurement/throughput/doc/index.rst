Measuring Channel Throughput
============================

Goals
-----

In this example, we explore the channel throughput statistics of wired and wireless transmission mediums.

| Verified with INET version: ``4.4``
| Source files location: `inet/showcases/measurement/throughput <https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/tree/master/showcases/measurement/throughput>`__

The Model
---------

The channel throughput is measured by observing the packets that are transmitted
through the transmission medium over time. For both wired and wireless channels,
the throughput is measured for any pair of communicating network interfaces,
separately for both directions.

.. the throughput is measured as a sliding window, the parameters can be set in the ResultRecorder HOW?

Channel throughput is a statistic of transmitter modules, such as the :ned:`PacketTransmitter` in :ned:`EthernetPhyLayer`.
Throughput is measured with a sliding window. By default, the window is 0.1s or 100 packets, whichever comes first.
The parameters of the window, such as the window interval, are configurable from the ini file, as ``module.statistic.parameter``. For example:

.. code-block:: ini

   *.host.eth[0].phyLayer.transmitter.throughput.interval = 0.2s

Here is the network:

.. figure:: media/Network.png
   :align: center

Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini

Results
-------

Here are the results:

.. figure:: media/throughput.png
   :align: center
   :width: 90%

The frequency of data points is denser than 0.1s, so the statistic is emitted more frequently, after 100 packets.

Try It Yourself
---------------

If you already have INET and OMNeT++ installed, start the IDE by typing
``omnetpp``, import the INET project into the IDE, then navigate to the
``inet/showcases/measurement/throughput`` folder in the `Project Explorer`. There, you can view
and edit the showcase files, run simulations, and analyze results.

Otherwise, there is an easy way to install INET and OMNeT++ using `opp_env
<https://omnetpp.org/opp_env>`__, and run the simulation interactively.
Ensure that ``opp_env`` is installed on your system, then execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env run inet-4.5 --init -w inet-workspace --install --build-modes=release --chdir \
       -c 'cd inet-4.5.*/showcases/measurement/throughput && inet'

This command creates an ``inet-workspace`` directory, installs the appropriate
versions of INET and OMNeT++ within it, and launches the ``inet`` command in the
showcase directory for interactive simulation.

Alternatively, for a more hands-on experience, you can first set up the
workspace and then open an interactive shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env install --init -w inet-workspace --build-modes=release inet-4.5
    $ cd inet-workspace
    $ opp_env shell

Inside the shell, start the IDE by typing ``omnetpp``, import the INET project,
then start exploring.
