Measuring Queueing Time
=======================

Goals
-----

In this example, we explore the queueing time statistics of queue modules of
network interfaces.

| Verified with INET version: ``4.4``
| Source files location: `inet/showcases/measurement/queueingtime <https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/tree/master/showcases/measurement/queueingtime>`__

The Model
---------

The queueing time is measured from the moment a packet is enqueued up to the
moment the same packet is dequeued from the queue. Simple packet queue modules
are also often used to build more complicated queues such as a priority queue
or even traffic shapers. The queueing time statistics are automatically collected
for each of these cases too.

Here is the network:

.. figure:: media/Network.png
   :align: center

Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini

Results
-------

Here are the results:

Try It Yourself
---------------

If you already have INET and OMNeT++ installed, start the IDE by typing
``omnetpp``, import the INET project into the IDE, then navigate to the
``inet/showcases/measurement/queueingtime`` folder in the `Project Explorer`. There, you can view
and edit the showcase files, run simulations, and analyze results.

Otherwise, there is an easy way to install INET and OMNeT++ using `opp_env
<https://omnetpp.org/opp_env>`__, and run the simulation interactively.
Ensure that ``opp_env`` is installed on your system, then execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env run inet-4.5 --init -w inet-workspace --install --build-modes=release --chdir \
       -c 'cd inet-4.5.*/showcases/measurement/queueingtime && inet'

This command creates an ``inet-workspace`` directory, installs the appropriate
versions of INET and OMNeT++ within it, and launches the ``inet`` command in the
showcase directory for interactive simulation.

Alternatively, for a more hands-on experience, you can first set up the
workspace and then open an interactive shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env install --init -w inet-workspace --build-modes=release inet-4.5
    $ cd inet-workspace
    $ opp_env shell

Inside the shell, start the IDE by typing ``omnetpp``, import the INET project,
then start exploring.
