Measuring Queueing Time
=======================

Goals
-----

In this example, we explore the queueing time statistics of queue modules of
network interfaces.

The Model
---------

The queueing time is measured from the moment a packet is enqueued up to the
moment the same packet is dequeued from the queue. Simple packet queue modules
are also often used to build more complicated queues such as a priority queue
or even traffic shapers. The queueing time statistics are automatically collected
for each of these cases too.

Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
