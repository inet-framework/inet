Measuring Propagation Time
==========================

Goals
-----

In this example, we explore the channel propagation time statistics for wired and
wireless transmission media.

The Model
---------

The packet propagation time is measured from the moment the beginning of a physical
signal encoding the packet leaves the transmitter network interface up to the moment
the beginning of the same physical signal arrives at the receiver network interface.
This time usually equals the same difference measured for the end of the physical
signal. The exception would be when the receiver is moving relative to the transmitter
with a relatively high speed compared to the propagation speed of the physical signal,
but it is rarely the case in communication network simulation.
