Measuring Residence Time
========================

Goals
-----

In this example, we explore the packet residence time statistics of network nodes.

| INET version: ``4.4``
| Source files location: `inet/showcases/measurement/residencetime <https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/tree/master/showcases/measurement/residencetime>`__

The Model
---------

The packet residence time is measured from the moment a packet enters a network
node up to the moment the same packet leaves the network node. This statistic
is also collected for packets that are created and/or destroyed in network
nodes.

Here is the network:

Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
