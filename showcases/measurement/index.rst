Measurement
===========

Most modules define several commonly used statistics in their NED file. Some of
these statistics are recorded into scalars, histograms or vectors by default,
but some additional ones must be enabled by the user from the INI file. The
recorded statistics are readily available in the result analysis tool of the
IDE.

The following group of examples demonstrate the most commonly used statistics:
