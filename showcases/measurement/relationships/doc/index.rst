Understanding Measurement Relationships
=======================================

Goals
-----

In this example, we explore the relationships between various measurements that
are presented in the measurement showcases.

The Model
---------

The end-to-end delay measured between two applications can be thought of as a sum
of different time categories such as queuing time, processing time, transmission
time, propagation time, and so on. Moreover, each one of these specific times can
be further split up between different network nodes, network interfaces, or even
smaller submodules.

Here is the network:

Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
