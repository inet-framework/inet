Measuring Packet Delay Variation
================================

Goals
-----

In this example, we explore the various packet delay variation (also known as packet jitter) statistics of application modules.

The Model
---------

The packet delay variation is measured in several different forms:

- *Instantaneous packet delay variation*: the difference between the packet delay of successive packets (``packetJitter`` statistic)
- *Variance of packet delay* (``packetDelayVariation`` statistic)
- *Packet delay difference compared to the mean value* (``packetDelayDifferenceToMean`` statistic)
