Differentiated Services
=======================

Goals
-----

Differentiated Services (DiffServ) was invented to provide a simple and
scalable quality of service (QoS) mechanism for IP networks.
Differentiated Services can, for example, be used to provide low latency
for delay-sensitive network traffic such as voice while providing simple
best-effort service to other services such as web traffic or file
transfer.

This showcase presents an example network that employs DiffServ to
provide preferential service to voice over other types of traffic.

About Differentiated Services
-----------------------------

The INET :doc:`User's Guide </users-guide/ch-diffserv>`, among many other
resources, contains a good overview of Differentiated Services.
If you are unfamiliar with the concept, we recommend you to read
that first, because here we provide a summary only.

Differentiated Services classifies traffic entering a DiffServ domain
into a limited number of forwarding classes, and encodes the forwarding
class into the 6-bit DSCP field of the IP header. The DSCP field will
then determine the treatment of packets (resource priority and drop
priority) at intermediate nodes.
In theory, a network could have up to 64 (i.e. 2^6) different traffic
classes using different DSCPs. In practice, however, most networks use
the following commonly defined per-hop behaviors:

- *Default PHB* typically maps to best-effort traffic.
- *Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHB* is dedicated to low-loss, low-latency
  traffic.
- *Assured Forwarding (AF) PHBs* give assurance of delivery under
  prescribed conditions; there are four classes and three drop
  probabilities, yielding twelve separate DSCP encodings from AF11
  through AF43.
- *Class Selector PHBs* provide backward compatibility with the
  IP Precedence field.

As EF is often used for carrying VoIP traffic, we'll also configure our
example network to do that.

The model
---------

The network
~~~~~~~~~~~

We will simulate one direction of a VoIP telephone call over the Internet
while background traffic is present. Background traffic will be heavy
enough to cause congestion in the first-hop router
and impair voice quality at the receiver. Then we will use DiffServ
to prioritize voice over background traffic to improve voice quality and
reduce latency.

The following image shows the layout of the network:

.. figure:: media/diffserv_network_layout.png
   :width: 100%

In our setup, ``voipPhone1`` will transmit VoIP packets to ``voipPhone2``.
``client`` will generate background traffic towards ``server``.
The ``internet`` node represents the Internet. We set the capacity of the link
between ``router`` and ``internet`` deliberately low, to 128kbps,
so we can more easily saturate it and demonstrate the effects of congestion on voice quality.

To make the example more realistic, ``voipPhone1`` will transmit the actual
contents of an audio file as VoIP traffic, and ``voipPhone2`` will record the
received audio into a WAV file. By playing back the WAV file produced by the
simulation, we can directly assess voice quality.

The background traffic will be constant bit rate UDP traffic. Note that we use
UDP instead of TCP because congestion control algorithms present in TCP make
it difficult to cause congestion with it.


Configuration and Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The showcase contains three different configurations:

- ``VoIP_WithoutQoS``: The queue in the router's PPP interface is
  overloaded and packets are dropped.
- ``VoIP_WithPolicing``: The VoIP traffic is classified as EF
  traffic and others as AF. AF traffic is rate
  limited using Token Bucket to 70% of the link's capacity.
- ``VoIP_WithPolicingAndQueuing``: This is the same as the previous
  configuration, except the router's queue is configured so that EF
  packets are prioritized over other packets, so lower delays are
  expected.

The router's PPP interface contains the key elements of Differentiated
Services in this network: a queue (``queue``) and a traffic conditioner (``egressTC``).
If both of them are used, the layout of the interface looks like the following:

.. figure:: media/RouterPPP.png
   :scale: 100%
   :align: center

In the ``VoIP_WithPolicing`` and ``VoIP_WithPolicingAndQueuing``
configurations, INET's :ned:`TrafficConditioner` module is used in the
router's PPP interface to achieve the required policing.

.. figure:: media/TrafficConditioner.png
   :scale: 100%
   :align: center

In :ned:`TrafficConditioner`, the ``mfClassifier`` submodule is used for
separating packets of different flows for marking with different DSCP values.
It contains a list of filters that identifies the flow and determines their classes.
Each filter can match the source and destination address, IP protocol
number, source and destination ports, or ToS of the datagram. The first
matching filter determines the index of the out gate. If no matching
filter is found, then the packet will be sent through the ``defaultOut``
gate. The filters that are used in this showcase can be found in the
``filters.xml`` file:

.. literalinclude:: ../filters.xml
   :language: xml

For example, the VoIP packets, which can be recognized by their
destination address ``voipPhone2`` and UDP destination port 1000, are
marked as EF traffic.

The DSCP field of the packets is then set by the modules named
``efMarker``, ``af11Marker``, ``af21Marker``, and ``beMarker``. The
differentiated handling of the marked packets is then achieved by
metering the traffic with the token bucket based meters ``efMeter`` and
``defaultMeter``, and dropping or reclassifying packets that do not
conform to the traffic profile. In particular, excess AF traffic will be
sent to the ``dropper`` module. Metering parameters are configured in
the ``omnetpp.ini`` file:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: WithPolicing
   :end-before: ####

In the ``VoIP_WithPolicingAndQueuing`` configuration, a
:ned:`DiffservQueue` module is used instead of :ned:`DropTailQueue` in the
router's PPP interface to achieve priority queuing.

.. figure:: media/DiffServQueue.png
   :scale: 100%
   :align: center

:ned:`DiffservQueue`, offered by INET, is an example queue that can be used
in interfaces of Differentiated Services core and edge nodes to support
AFxy and EF per-hop behaviors. The incoming packets are first classified
by the ``classifier`` module according to their DSCP field previously
set in the traffic conditioner. EF packets - these are the VoIP packets
in this case - are stored in a dedicated queue, and served first when a
packet is requested. Because they can preempt the other queues, the rate
of the EF packets should be limited to a fraction of the bandwidth of
the link. Limiting is achieved by metering the EF traffic with a token
bucket meter and dropping packets that do not conform to the traffic
profile configured in the ``omnetpp.ini`` file:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: WithQueueing
   :end-before: ####

We examine the results of the three different configurations listed
above.

Results
-------

Original Audio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a reference, you can listen to the original audio file by clicking
the play button below:

.. audio:: ../bensound-pianomoment.wav

Without QoS
~~~~~~~~~~~

As expected, the quality of the received sound using the
``VoIP_WithoutQoS`` configuration is very low:

.. audio:: media/VoIP_WithoutQoS_results.wav

The jaggedness in the received audio is because approximately half
of the VoIP packets sent by ``voipPhone1`` are dropped by :ned:`DropTailQueue`
in the output interface of the router.

The delay of the VoIP packets also is very high, approximately 2.5 seconds,
which is way too much compared to a real phone call. The following plot
shows the delay of each VoIP packet:

.. figure:: media/VoIP_WithoutQoS_delay.png
   :width: 100%

The dropouts you hear can also easily be observed if we zoom into the
timeline of the received audio using `Audacity <https://www.audacityteam.org/>`__:

With Traffic Policing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, we use a traffic conditioner inside the router's
PPP interface. The following (edited) video, captured from the
simulation, shows the classification and the differentiated handling of
the packets in the traffic conditioner.

.. video:: media/TrafficConditioner.mp4
   :width: 100%

We can see that VoIP packets (``VOICE``, ``SILENCE``) are classified as
EF traffic, while the packets generated by ``client`` are classified as
AF traffic. As a result, the data rate of the VoIP traffic increases and
no VoIP packets are dropped.

The changes result in better sound quality. Dropouts can now only be observed
at the beginning of the recording:

.. audio:: media/VoIP_WithPolicing_results.wav

The following plot shows the delay of the VoIP packets:

.. figure:: media/VoIP_WithPolicing_delay.png
   :width: 100%

Although the delay of the packets is much less than it was with the
previous configuration (0.3s instead of 2.5s), it is still very high for
IP telephony.

The dropout problem that was present throughout the whole transmission
using the first configuration is successfully eliminated, as we can see
if we take a look at the audio track:

.. figure:: media/VoIP_WithPolicing_audio.png
   :width: 100%

With Traffic Policing and Priority Queuing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the ``VoIP_WithPolicingAndQueuing`` configuration, the router's queue
is configured to prioritize EF packets over other traffic.
The following video shows how the different types of packets are handled:

.. video:: media/DiffServQueue.mp4
   :width: 480
   :align: center

Note that the ``priority`` module always prefers ``efQueue``; it only takes packets
from the other queues (via ``wrr``) when ``efQueue`` is empty.

The fact that EF packets face shorter queues and have priority reduces their latency.
Some delay still remains, of course, but the best audio quality could be
reached with this configuration. The initial dropouts that were present in
the previous configuration are almost inaudible now.

.. audio:: media/VoIP_WithPolicingAndQueueing_results.wav

As seen from the next plot, the delay of voice packets has been reduced to about 0.11s:
