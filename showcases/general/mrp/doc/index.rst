Media Redundancy Protocol (MRP)
===============================

Goals
-----

INET has the capability to record PCAP traces from simulations. These PCAP files
have the same format as real-world PCAP traces, so that the same tools and
techniques used to analyze real traffic can also be applied to simulated
traffic. This means that popular tools like Wireshark and tcpdump can be
leveraged in the context of simulations.

This demonstration includes a sample simulation that generates and records PCAP
traces of TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic, using various physical layer protocols
such as Ethernet and 802.11.

The model
---------

To record PCAP traces in a node, a :ned:`PcapRecorder` module
needs to be included in it. Pcap recorder modules can be easily included
in hosts and routers by specifying their :par:`numPcapRecorders` parameter
(available in modules that extend :ned:`LinkLayerNodeBase`, such as
:ned:`StandardHost` and derivatives, and router modules.)

The PCAP recorder module records packets sent to and from modules that
are in the same host as the PCAP recorder module. It writes traces in a
PCAP file, which has to be specified by the :par:`pcapFile` parameter.
This parameter acts as the main switch for recording, thus specifying
this parameter enables packet capture. The PCAP recorder can write traces
in the original or the next-generation PCAP file format, selected by the
:par:`fileFormat` parameter (``pcap`` or ``pcapng``).

The :par:`moduleNamePatterns` parameter specifies which modules' traffic
should be recorded. It takes a space separated list of module names. For
selecting a module vector, ``[*]`` can be used. The recorded modules are
on the same level in the hierarchy as the PCAP recorder module. The
default value for the :par:`moduleNamePatterns` parameter is
``wlan[*] eth[*] ppp[*]``, so it records the most commonly
present L2 interfaces. The :par:`dumpProtocols` parameter is a filter and
selects which protocols to include in the capture. It matches packets
which are of the specified protocol type at the level of capture, but
not the protocol type of encapsulated packets. The parameter takes
protocol names registered in INET (see
`/inet/src/inet/common/Protocol.cc <https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/blob/master/src/inet/common/Protocol.cc>`__)
The parameter's default value is ``"ethernetmac ppp ieee80211mac"``.

By default, the PCAP recorder module records L2 frames, but setting the
``moduleNamePatterns`` to ``ipv4``, for example, lets one record L3
frames (note that the parameter's value is lowercase because it refers
to the actual ``ipv4`` module in the host, not the module type.)

Additionally, the :par:`packetFilter` parameter can use an expression
to filter packets. The expression is evaluated for all packets to
a boolean value indicating a match. The expression can contain the packet's
fields (such as its name), contained chunks and their fields, protocol
headers, etc. The default value is ``*`` that matches all packets,
thus no packets are filtered.  For more information on the packet filter,
refer to the TODO section in the INET User's Guide.

To summarize: the :par:`moduleNamePatterns` parameter specifies which
modules' outputs should be captured. The :par:`pcapNetwork` parameter sets
the link-layer header type according to the captured module outputs, so
PCAP programs can interpret the PCAP file correctly. The
:par:`dumpProtocols` parameter can narrow the set of recorded protocols at
the level of capture. The :par:`packetFilter` parameter can further
narrow the set of captured packets.

The configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example simulation for this showcase contains wired hosts, wireless
hosts, and routers. The hosts are configured to generate TCP, UDP and
ICMP traffic. The hosts connect to routers via Ethernet; the connection
between the routers is PPP. The wireless hosts communicate via 802.11.
The simulation can be run by choosing the ``PcapRecording``
configuration from the ini file. The simulation uses the following
network:

.. figure:: media/network2.png
   :width: 100%

The network contains two ``adhocHost``\ s named ``host1`` and ``host2``,
and two :ned:`StandardHost`\ s named ``ethHost1`` and ``ethHost2``. There
are two :ned:`Router` modules (``router1`` and ``router2``), which are
connected by PPP. Each wired host is connected to one of
the routers via Ethernet. The network also contains an
:ned:`Ipv4NetworkConfigurator`, an :ned:`Ieee80211ScalarRadioMedium`, and an
:ned:`IntegratedMultiVisualizer` module.

Traffic generation is set up the following way: ``host1`` is configured
to send a UDP stream to ``host2`` (via 802.11), ``ethHost1`` is
configured to open a TCP connection to ``ethHost2``, and send a 1Mbyte
file (via Ethernet). Additionally, ``ethHost1`` is configured to ping
``ethHost2``.

.. todo::

   <!-- V1

   There are :ned:`PcapRecorder` modules added to `host1`, `host2`, `ethHost1`,
   `router1`, and `router2`. The keys in the ini file pertaining to PCAP recording
   configuration are the following:

   .. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
      :language: ini
      :start-at: host1.numPcapRecorders
      :end-before: verbose

   We configure `host1`'s PCAP recorder to use the 802.11 link-layer headers,
   and `ethHost1`'s PCAP recorder to use Ethernet link-layer headers.
   There are two PCAP recorder modules in `router1`, with one of them recording
   Ethernet traffic on `eth0` and the other PPP traffic on `ppp0`.
   Additionally, there is a PCAP recorder in `ethHost2`, which is set to record
   traffic of the `ipv4` module. -->

   <!-- V2 -->

We set up multiple PCAP recorder modules in various hosts in the
network:

In ``host1``, we'll record 802.11 traffic on the ``wlan0`` interface. We
configure ``host1``'s PCAP recorder to use the 802.11 link-layer
headers:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: host1.numPcapRecorders
   :end-at: /host1.pcap

In ``host2``, we'll record only the ARP packets from the 802.11 traffic
on ``wlan0``. The link-layer header type is set to 802.11, and the
:par:`packetFilter` is set to record only to packets of ``ArpPacket``
class:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: host2.numPcapRecorders
   :end-at: packetFilter

The :par:`packetFilter` parameter's value ``*ArpPacket`` matches the
``inet::ArpPacket`` class. There is an ARP request packet open in the
packet inspector on the following image:

.. figure:: media/arppacketclass.png
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

In ``ethHost1``, we'll record Ethernet traffic on the ``eth0``
interface. We set the link-layer header type to ethernet:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: ethHost1.numPcapRecorders
   :end-at: /ethHost1.pcap

There are two PCAP recorder modules in ``router1``, with one of them
recording Ethernet traffic on ``eth0`` and the other PPP traffic on
``ppp0``. The :par:`moduleNamePatters` parameter needs to be set for both
PCAP recorder modules, because ``router1`` has two interfaces.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: router1.numPcapRecorders
   :end-before: router2.numPcapRecorders

In ``router2``, we'll record only packets carrying TCP data on the
``eth0`` interface. ``router2`` has two interfaces, so the
:par:`moduleNamePatters` parameter needs to be set. The link-layer header
type is set to ethernet, and the packet data filter is set to match
packets containing an ``Ipv4Header``, and where the ``totalLengthField``
field's value is 576 (the size of TCP data packets with IP
encapsulation):

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: router2.numPcapRecorders
   :end-at: totalLengthField

In ``ethHost2``, we'll record traffic of the ``ipv4`` module. The
:par:`dumpProtocols` parameter's default is
``ethernetmac ppp ieee80211mac``, so it has to be set to ``ipv4``.

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: ethHost2.numPcapRecorders
   :end-at: dumpProtocols

By default, modules like :ned:`Ipv4` and :ned:`EthernetInterface` don't
compute CRC and FCS frames, but assumes they are correct ("declared
correct" mode.) To include the CRC and FCS values in the
capture file, L2 and L3 modules need to be set to compute CRC and FCS:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: crcMode
   :end-at: fcsMode

Note that these settings are required, otherwise an error is returned.

The :par:`alwaysFlush` parameter controls whether to write packets to the
PCAP file as they are recorded or after the simulation has concluded.
It is ``false`` by default, but it's set to ``true`` in all PCAP
recorders to make sure there are recorded packets even if the simulation
crashes:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: alwaysFlush
   :end-at: alwaysFlush
