IEEE 802.11 Handover
====================

Goals
-----

This simulation demonstrates the handover process between two access points (APs)
in an 802.11 wireless LAN operating in infrastructure mode. The demonstration
highlights the various steps involved in the handover, including beacon
transmission, active scanning, authentication, and association. The goal of this
simulation is to illustrate the realism and accuracy of the INET Framework in
simulating real-world wireless network scenarios.

The Model
---------

In 802.11 infrastructure mode, wireless hosts need to be associated with
an access point before data exchange can occur. The hosts can find an
access point in two ways. One is active scanning, where hosts transmit
Probe Request frames, and the APs reply to them with Probe Response
frames. The other is passive scanning, where hosts locate APs by
receiving their broadcast Beacon frames. APs emit Beacon frames
periodically, announcing their presence (unless configured to be
hidden). In this simulation, the host uses active scanning.

When the host has discovered the available APs, it decides which one to
join. When the host wants to join an AP, it initiates an authentication
frame exchange with the AP. Following successful authentication, the
host starts the association frame exchange. During the association
process, they agree on the encryption type and other 802.11 capabilities
to use, and the AP grants the host access to the network. When
the association is complete, data exchange can begin.

The example simulation will use the following network:

.. figure:: media/network2.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

The network contains two APs placed 400 meters apart, and a wireless
host. The two access points are set to use channels 2 and 3. The host is
configured to actively scan channels 0 through 4. During the simulation, the
host will move out of range of one access point and into the range of
the other. In this model, when scanning for APs, the host will always
choose the one with the strongest signal. In this simulation, there are
no applications configured in the host to send or receive data, so we
will not be able to observe data exchange. The host will just be
associated to the APs, and keep receiving beacon frames.

Results
-------

The following animation shows what happens when the simulation is run:

   :align: center

At the beginning of the simulation, the host starts to scan the
channels, looking for an access point to associate with. This process is
started by the host's agent module, as it is set to active scanning. (In
INET, an 802.11 interface consists of a MAC module, a management module
that deals with management frames, and an agent module that initiates
scanning, association, and other high-level actions.)

During the scanning process, the host sends a Probe Request frame in
each channel starting from channel 0, until it receives a Probe
Response. As AP1 is on channel 2, the host sends out three Probe
Requests before it gets a Probe Response. This frame exchange is shown in the following
packet log.

When the host gets the Probe Response, it initiates the authentication
process. After that is completed, it starts the association process. The
authentication process consists of several steps. When it becomes
associated with AP1, a text bubble appears at the host indicating that
it is associated with the AP. The authentication and association
processes are shown in the packet log below.

The dotted arrows indicate recent successful physical layer
transmissions. In this example, they will be used to visualize that the
host is associated with an AP. The APs send out beacon frames
periodically, which is now configured to be 100 ms. These frames are
received by the host, which constantly reinforces the physical link
visualizer arrows. When the host is in range of AP1, the only
communication is the host receiving AP1's beacon frames. This reception is
indicated by the dotted arrow, which only goes from the AP to the host.

The host remains associated with AP1 as long as it is within communication
range, even though it gets into the communication range of AP2 after a
while (when it enters the area where the two APs' communication range
circles overlap). As it leaves AP1's range, the host detects that it no
longer receives AP1's beacon frames. A text bubble appears at the host
indicating that it has lost the beacon. The scanning process is
restarted by the host's agent module. This is triggered when several
consecutive beacon frames are not received.

This time it takes four Probe Request frames to get a response because
AP2 is on channel 3.

The host is handed over to AP2 using the authentication and association
process discussed earlier. It will remain associated with AP2 until it
leaves AP2's communication range.

The host's ``mgmt`` module contains a variable that indicates which
access point the host is associated with.

The ``mgmt`` modules of access points maintain a list of hosts that are
associated with them.
