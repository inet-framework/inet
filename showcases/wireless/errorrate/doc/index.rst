Packet Loss vs. Distance Using Various WiFi Bitrates
====================================================

Goals
-----

In this showcase, we perform a parameter study where we examine how the packet error
rate changes as a function of distance in an 802.11g wireless network.
The packet error rate is measured at various WiFi
bitrates, providing insights into the impact of different bitrates on the
quality of communication over different distances.

The Model
---------

The network contains two hosts operating in 802.11g ad-hoc mode at 10 mW
transmission power. One of the hosts acts as a traffic source, the other
as a traffic sink. We will perform a parameter study with the distance and
the bitrate as parameters. The distance will run between 10 and 550
meters, in 2-meter steps. The bitrate will take the ERP modes in
802.11g: 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. This results in about
2100 simulation runs.

To make the model more realistic, we will simulate multipath propagation
using the :ned:`TwoRayGroundReflection` path loss model. (There are various
path loss models in INET, including :ned:`FreeSpacePathLoss`,
:ned:`RayleighFading`, :ned:`RicianFading`, :ned:`LogNormalShadowing`, and
:ned:`NakagamiFading`). The two-ray ground reflection path loss model
requires a ground model, which is configured in the
``physicalEnvironment`` module to be :ned:`FlatGround`. The heights of the
hosts above the ground are set to 1.5 meters. We assume isotropic
background noise of -86 dBm (:ned:`IsotropicScalarBackgroundNoise`).

We will use the :ned:`Ieee80211NistErrorModel` to compute bit errors. The
:ned:`Ieee80211NistErrorModel` is based on the Nist error rate model.

In each simulation run, the source host will send a single UDP packet
(56 bytes of UDP data, resulting in a 120-byte frame) to the destination
host as a probe. At packet reception, the error model will compute the bit
error rate (BER) from the signal-to-noise-plus-interference-ratio
(SNIR). The packet error rate (PER) will be computed from the BER. The
simulation records SNIR, BER, and PER. Note that in this simulation
model, the physical layer simulation is entirely deterministic, hence
there is no need for Monte Carlo.


.. comment

   - the snir threshold is important because when the transmission's snir is below this value, the reception is not simulated because it is assumed to be incorrect.
   - thus we have to set the snir threshold low enough to get more fine-grained data at low snir levels

We lower the :par:`snirThreshold` parameter of the hosts' radios from 4 to
0 dB. When the transmission's SNIR is below this value, the reception is
assumed to be incorrect, and the reception is not simulated. Lowering
the level results in more fine-grained data at low SNIR levels.

Results
-------

SNIR, BER, and PER are recorded from the simulation runs. SNIR is
measured at the receiver and depends on the power of the noise and the
power of the signal. The signal power decreases with distance, so the SNIR
does as well. SNIR is independent of modulations and coding schemes, so
it is the same for all bitrates. This can be seen in the following plot,
which displays SNIR against distance.

The next plot shows how the packet error rate decreases with SNIR. Slower
bitrates use simpler modulation like binary phase shift keying, which is
more tolerant to noise than more complex modulations used by faster
bitrates. Hence, there is a difference in the graph between the different
bitrates.

The various modulations and coding rates of 802.11g ERP modes are the
following:

-  6 and 9 Mbit/s modes use BPSK, coding rates 1/2 and 3/4
-  12 and 18 Mbit/s modes use QPSK, coding rates 1/2 and 3/4
-  24 and 36 Mbit/s modes use 16-QAM, coding rates 1/2 and 3/4
-  48 and 54 Mbit/s modes use 64-QAM, coding rates 1/2 and 3/4

Note that the completely flat and completely vertical lines on the plot
are due to the signal power decreasing below the sensitivity of the
receiver.

The following plot shows the packet error rate vs. distance. Again,
slower bitrates show fewer packet errors as the distance increases
because of the simpler modulation.

   :width: 100%

We also compute the effective bitrate, which is the gross bitrate
decreased by packet errors. It is computed with the following formula:

``effective bitrate = (1 - PER) * nominal bitrate``

It is equal to the nominal data bitrate unless it is decreased because
of bit errors as the distance increases.

Effective bitrate vs. distance is shown on the next plot. Higher bitrates
are more sensitive to increases in distance, as the effective bitrate
drops rapidly after a critical distance. This critical distance is
farther for slower bitrates, and the decrease is not as rapid.

802.11 ranges depend on many variables, e.g., transmission power,
receiver sensitivity, antenna gains and directionality, and background
noise levels. The above ranges correspond to arbitrary values for the
variables. In reality, ranges can vary significantly.

Conclusion
----------

The packet error rate increases quickly as the distance approaches the
critical point. Slower bitrates are less sensitive to increasing
distance because they use simpler modulation. Faster bitrate modes are
advantageous in short distances because of the increased throughput, but
slower modes work better at longer distances. Furthermore, using rate
adaptation, a host can use fast modes for short distances and slower
modes for larger ones. When the number of lost packets increases and
throughput drops, it becomes more viable to change to a slower bitrate
mode. For example, the rate control algorithm could change to the slower
bitrate at around the critical point, about where the curves for two
adjacent bitrate modes intersect.
