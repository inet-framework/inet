Scaling Example
===============

Goals
-----

This example examines how simulations scale up as the number of
simulated wireless hosts is increased. The metric of scalability is the
running time of the simulation. There are a number of simulation runs
running until the same sim-time-limit, and each contains an increasing
number of hosts. The running time is plotted as the function of the
number of hosts contained.

The model
---------

**The network**

The network contains a variable number of ``WirelessHost``\ s. The exact
number is specified by the ``numHosts`` variable, and is increased in
subsequent simulation runs. The hosts are randomly placed on the
playground.

**Scenarios**

Host[0] acts as the target for traffic generated by the other hosts.
There are different configurations using different radio models and
different traffic models that can be compared, according to running
time. The two radio models are ``UnitDiskRadio`` and
``ApskScalarRadio``. The two traffic models are ping requests and UDP
packets.

For each case there are multiple simulation runs, with increasing number
of hosts. The simulation runs use these logarithmically increasing
``numHosts`` values: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, with each
simulation running for 0.1s simulated time. The running time of each run
is recorded in scalar result files, so they can be analyzed.

``UnitDiskRadio`` is simpler than ``ApskScalarRadio``, and it is
expected that it scales better. Occasional short ping requests are
expected to scale better than UDP traffic that fills the channel, as it
has more computing requirements.

**Configurations**

There are 4 configurations for 4 dististinct cases:

-  Hosts send ping requests to host[0]. The radio model is
   ``UnitDiskRadio``, with interference turned off.

-  Hosts send ping requests to host[0]. The radio model is
   ``ApskScalarRadio``, with CSMA-CA turned on to avoid collisions.

-  Hosts send UDP packets to host[0]. The radio model is
   ``UnitDiskRadio``, with interference turned off.

-  Hosts send UDP packets to host[0]. The radio model is
   ``ApskScalarRadio``, with CSMA-CA turned on.

Results

Optional: How to make the charts

The simulation of the physical layer of radios scale by n^2 at the very
least, because every transmission is sent to every host, and it is
processed by every host to determine if it can receive them. However,
the results indicate that the running time scales linearly, because the
number of hosts is low, and simulating the physical layer is not
domninant.
