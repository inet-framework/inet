Crosstalk Between Adjacent IEEE 802.11 Channels
===============================================

Goals
-----

Crosstalk between adjacent IEEE 802.11 channels refers to the interference that
can occur when transmissions on different channels overlap in frequency. In the
IEEE 802.11 standard, which is commonly used for wireless networking, there are
a number of different channels that can be used, depending on the frequency
range (e.g. 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz). In a real-world scenario, it is rare for all
devices to be using the same channel, and there may be multiple networks
operating on different channels at the same location. When transmissions on
adjacent channels overlap in frequency, they can interfere with each other and
affect the performance of the network.

INET has support for simulating communication on
different IEEE 802.11 channels, both in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency ranges.
In this showcase, we will demonstrate how to use overlapping and non-overlapping
channels in simulations and how transmissions on different channels can
interfere with each other. By the end of this showcase, you will understand the
impact of crosstalk between adjacent 802.11 channels and how it can be simulated.

This showcase divides the topic of the simulation of different Wifi
channels into three cases:

-  **Completely overlapping frequency bands**: all nodes communicate on
   the same Wifi channel
-  **Independent frequency bands**: nodes communicate on different
   channels that don't affect each other
-  **Partially overlapping frequency bands**: nodes communicate on
   adjacent channels, which interfere with each other

Each case is demonstrated with an example simulation.

The model
---------

The 2.4 GHz frequency range in 802.11g, for example, can use a limited
number of channels (13 in the EU). The bandwidth of transmissions in
802.11g is 20MHz, and channels are spaced 5MHz apart. Thus adjacent
channels overlap, and transmissions on these channels can interfere. There can
be a few independent channels, where there is no cross-channel
interference, e.g., Channels 1, 6, and 11, as illustrated below.

.. figure:: media/channels.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

In INET, the scalar analog model represents signals with a scalar signal power,
and a constant center frequency and bandwidth. The scalar model can only handle
situations when the spectra of two concurrent signals are identical or don't
overlap at all. When using the dimensional analog model, signal power can change
in both time and frequency; more realistic signal shapes can be specified.
This model is also able to calculate the interference of signals whose spectra
partially overlap.

There are example simulations for the three cases outlined in the Goals
section. In the cases of completely overlapping channels and independent channels,
the simulations use the scalar analog model; in the case of the partially overlapping
channels, the dimensional analog model is used.

All simulations use variations of the same network, which is
illustrated by the image below:

.. figure:: media/basenetwork.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

The networks contain four :ned:`AdhocHost`'s, named ``host1`` to
``host4``. The networks also contain an :ned:`Ipv4NetworkConfigurator`
module, an :ned:`IntegratedVisualizer` module, and one or two radio medium modules.
The number and type of the radio medium modules vary in the networks
for the different simulations. All hosts
are within communication range of each other.
The hosts are arranged in
a rectangle; ``host1`` is configured to send UDP packets to ``host2``, and similarly,
``host3`` sends UDP packets to ``host4``. The configuration keys common to all
simulations, specifying e.g. traffic generation and visualization, are
defined in the ``General`` configuration in :download:`omnetpp.ini <../omnetpp.ini>`.
The following sections detail the three configurations.

.. note:: By default, 802.11 hosts and access points in INET are configured to use the same Wifi channel (Channel 1).

Completely Overlapping Frequency Bands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simulation for this case demonstrates the hosts communicating on the
same Wifi channel, the default Channel 1. The simulation can be run by
selecting the ``CompletelyOverlappingFrequencyBands`` configuration from
the ini file. The configuration doesn't specify anything beyond the keys
of the ``General`` configuration, so it's empty:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: CompletelyOverlappingFrequencyBands
   :end-before: IndependentFrequencyBandsOneScalarRadioMediumModule
   :language: ini

Since the frequency and bandwidth of transmissions for all
hosts are exactly the same, inferring which transmissions interfere is
obvious (all of them). In this case, a scalar analog model is sufficient.
The following video shows the node-pairs communicating; the number of
sent/received packets is displayed above the nodes, as well as the state
of the contention modules of the transmitting hosts.

.. video:: media/overlapping1.mp4
  :width: 90%
  :align: center

   <!--internal video recording, animation speed none, playback speed 0.59, zoom 1.69, display message name and message class off, run until event 141-->

At first, the two source nodes, ``host1`` and ``host3``, start
transmitting at the same time. The transmissions collide, and neither
destination host is able to receive any of them correctly. The collision
avoidance mechanism takes effect, and ``host3`` wins channel access.
Both nodes can transmit their data successfully after one another.

Independent Frequency Bands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this case, we are modeling host-pairs that are communicating on
different, non-overlapping Wifi channels (e.g., Channels 1 and 6). Since
the channels are independent, it is obvious that there won't be any
interference. The scalar analog model is sufficient for this case.

In the first configuration for this case, the hosts use the same radio
medium module. The simulation can be run by choosing the
``IndependentFrequencyBandsOneScalarRadioMediumModule`` configuration
from the ini file. The radios of the two host pairs are configured
to use the non-overlapping Channels 1 and 6:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: IndependentFrequencyBandsOneScalarRadioMediumModule
   :end-at: 6
   :language: ini

.. note:: The channel numbers are set to 0 and 5 because in INET's 802.11 model, the channels are numbered from 0, so that this setting corresponds to Wifi Channels 1 and 6.

The video below shows the hosts communicating:

.. video:: media/independent2.mp4
  :width: 90%
  :align: center

   <!--internal video recoding, animation speed none, playback speed 0.59, zoom 1.69, display message name and message class off, run until event 159-->

Since host-pairs communicate on independent channels, there is no
interference. ``host1`` and ``host3`` can transmit simultaneously, and
their transmissions are correctly receivable by both destination hosts.
Note that all transmissions are sent to all hosts by the radio medium
module.

Since they transmit/receive on different, non-interfering channels, it is obvious that ``host4`` cannot receive ``host1``'s
transmissions, just as ``host2`` cannot receive ``host3``'s
transmissions. Yet the radio medium module sent all transmissions to all
hosts, where the radio module decided that some of the transmissions
cannot be received because the host's receiver is set to a different
channel.

The simulation can be optimized by omitting these unnecessary message
sends by the radio medium, by using two radio medium modules and configuring
the non-interfering host-pairs to use different radio mediums.
By using two radio medium modules, the simulation scales better as the number of nodes increases.

The second example simulation demonstrates the use of two radio medium
modules to optimize the simulation. The simulation can be run by
choosing the ``IndependentFrequencyBandsTwoScalarRadioMediumModules``
configuration from the ini file:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: IndependentFrequencyBandsTwoScalarRadioMediumModules
   :end-at: 6
   :language: ini

Here, the radios of each host pair are set to use one of the two radio medium modules
(by default, radios use the one named ``radioMedium``).
Also, the non-overlapping channels are configured,
but from the perspective of interference, it doesn't make any difference,
as the use of two radio modules prevents interference anyway.

The following video shows the
host-pairs communicating:

.. video:: media/independent_2radiomediums1.mp4
  :width: 90%
  :align: center

   <!--internal video recording, animation speed none, playback speed 0.59, zoom 1.69, display message name and message class off, run until event 129-->

The host pairs communicate without interference.
Notice that there are only message sends between hosts using the same radio medium module.

Partially Overlapping Frequency Bands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this case, the host pairs communicate on different Wifi channels, which
partially overlap in frequency. The scalar analog model is insufficient to
simulate partially overlapping channels, thus we use the dimensional analog model.
The example simulation for this case uses the
``CrosstalkShowcasePartiallyOverlappingFrequencyBands`` network, which contains
a :ned:`Ieee80211DimensionalRadioMedium` module. The simulation is specified
in the ``PartiallyOverlappingFrequencyBands`` configuration.
The hosts are configured to have :ned:`Ieee80211DimensionalRadio` modules.
The host pairs are set to adjacent Wifi Channels 1 and 2.
Also, a more realistic signal spectrum is configured, based on the spectral mask
of OFDM transmissions, as in the 802.11 standard:

.. figure:: media/spectralmask_wifi.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

Here is the configuration in :download:`omnetpp.ini <../omnetpp.ini>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: PartiallyOverlappingFrequencyBands
   :end-at: frequencyGains
   :language: ini

The following video shows the host pairs communicating:

.. video:: media/partial3.mp4
   :width: 90%
   :align: center

.. animation speed none, playback speed 0.47, zoom 1.69, run until event 84

Even though they are on different channels, the transmissions interfere.
In the beginning, ``host1`` and ``host3`` transmit simultaneously,
and neither transmission can be successfully received.
Due to the collision avoidance mechanism, one of the transmitting hosts
defers from transmitting, and the subsequent transmissions are successful.
