IEEE 802.11 Fragmentation
=========================

Goals
-----

The process of fragmentation is used to improve the performance of 802.11
networks in situations where there is interference, noise, or long distances
between nodes. It does this by dividing larger frames into smaller fragments,
which increases the probability of successful data transfer. This showcase
presents an example of how MAC-level fragmentation is used in INET.

About 802.11 Fragmentation
--------------------------

Fragmentation in 802.11 reduces packet errors in certain situations,
e.g. in a noisy environment. A larger frame has a higher chance of
getting corrupted than a smaller one.
The error correcting mechanism can correct some erroneous bits in a received frame,
but as the bit error rate
increases, it becomes less likely that it can correct all bit errors.
In 802.11, a frame can be fragmented to a maximum of 16 fragments.

.. The error correcting mechanism can correct less and less bits as the
   bit error rate increases. -> actually, as the bit error rate increases,
   there is less and less chance for the error correcting mechanism to correct
   bit errors.

   but it becomes
   ineffective above a certain bit error rate.

The downside is that fragmentation increases overhead, and thus decreases throughput
and channel utilization. The smaller packets resulting from fragmentation
each have PHY and MAC headers, and each packet transmission might be followed
by a contention period and ACK (depending on block ack policy and whether
TXOP is used). Also, fragmentation increases delay, because an incoming packet
only arrives at the application when all of its fragments have been received.

.. To illustrate the extra overhead, let us look at the fragmentation of
   an a 1000-byte packet created by a UDP application. After adding
   8 byte UDP header, 20 byte IPv4 header and 8 byte LLC header, the packet
   enters the MAC as a 1036-byte packet. With the 24 byte MAC header (in the DCF case)
   and 4-byte trailer (checksum), the frame is 1064 bytes. If the fragmentation threshold
   is set to 400 bytes, the following fragments are produced by the MAC:
   - 400B fragment: 24B MAC header + 8B LLC header + 20B IPv4 header + 8B UDP header + 336B data + 4B MAC trailer
   - 400B fragment: 24B MAC header + 372B data + 4B MAC trailer
   - 320B fragment: 24B MAC header + 292B data + 4B MAC trailer
   This adds up to 1120 bytes (vs. 1064 bytes in the unfragmented case).

802.11 Fragmentation in INET
----------------------------

In INET, 802.11 fragmentation is controlled by fragmentation policies
in :ned:`Ieee80211Mac`. By default, the :ned:`Dcf` and :ned:`Hcf` submodules
of :ned:`Ieee80211Mac` contain a fragmentation policy submodule
(at ``mac.dcf.originatorMacDataService.fragmentationPolicy``
and ``mac.hcf.originatorMacDataService.fragmentationPolicy``).
The default fragmentation policy type is :ned:`BasicFragmentationPolicy`.

:ned:`BasicFragmentationPolicy` has just one parameter,
:par:`fragmentationThreshold`. Frames larger than this value are fragmented.
The value includes the MAC header, the payload, and the MAC trailer.
The MAC overhead (header + trailer) is 28 bytes with DCF and 30 bytes with HCF.
The default for this parameter is 1500 bytes.

.. note:: Caveat: In addition to :par:`fragmentationThreshold`, :ned:`Ieee80211Mac` also
   has a parameter named :par:`mtu` (maximum transfer unit), which appears to be
   similar in purpose. However, MTU controls IP level fragmentation
   on the interface the MAC is part of, i.e. it is actually used by the IP module
   instead of the MAC. The two are related; for example, by setting MTU to an
   appropriately small value, one can achieve that 802.11 fragmentation is
   never triggered (for IP packets at least).

The Model
---------

The example simulation contains two wireless nodes. One of them sends large UDP
packets to the other via Wifi in a noisy environment. The simulation will be run
with fragmentation turned off and turned on. We'll examine the effect of fragmentation
on the Wifi performance. We'll also see how TXOP and block acknowledgments affect
the performance. Furthermore, we'll examine the domain of effectiveness for fragmentation.

The example simulation uses the following network:

.. figure:: media/network3.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

The network contains two :ned:`AdhocHost`'s named ``wifiHost1`` and ``wifiHost2``.
It also contains an :ned:`Ipv4NetworkConfigurator`, an :ned:`IntegratedCanvasVisualizer`,
and an :ned:`Ieee80211RadioMedium` module.

Configuration keys for the UDP traffic, the radio, and the radio medium are defined
in the ``General`` configuration in :download:`omnetpp.ini <../omnetpp.ini>`.

``wifiHost1`` sends 2000-byte UDP packets to ``wifiHost2`` every 0.5 seconds,
which corresponds to about 32 Mbps of application-level traffic. The hosts operate
in 802.11g mode with 54 Mbps data rate. Here is the traffic configuration in
:download:`omnetpp.ini <../omnetpp.ini>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: wifiHost1.numApps
   :end-at: wifiHost2.app[0].localPort
   :language: ini

We make the environment noisy by lowering the transmission power. Also, to make the
simulation more precise, we lower various thresholds to prevent certain shortcuts
in the computations from kicking in. Here is the configuration in
:download:`omnetpp.ini <../omnetpp.ini>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: energyDetection
   :end-at: power
   :language: ini

We want to demonstrate that fragmenting packets is advantageous in a noisy
environment, so we set the transmission power accordingly. If there is too
much noise, the fragmentation doesn't make any difference, as communication
becomes impossible. If there is too little noise, fragmentation is disadvantageous
due to the extra overhead.

The simulation will be run with four scenarios. Each scenario aims to improve
the noisy channel performance of the previous one. They are defined in the
following configurations:

- ``DCFnofrag``: The MAC uses DCF, and there is no fragmentation. It is expected that only a few of the large packets will be received successfully; throughput will be low.
- ``DCFfrag``: The MAC uses DCF, and packets are fragmented. Due to the smaller fragments, packet error rate should decrease, and throughput should increase compared to the previous scenario.
- ``HCFfrag``: The MAC uses HCF, packets are fragmented, and transmitted during a TXOP. Throughput should increase even more, as the sender node doesn't have to contend for channel access before transmitting each packet (although packets are ACKed individually).
- ``HCFfragblockack``: This is the same as the previous scenario, but block acknowledgments are enabled. Throughput should increase yet again, as the receiver node doesn't have to ACK each packet individually.

The simulations will be run for 10 seconds, and we'll examine the number of packets
received by the UDP application of ``wifiHost2``, and the application level throughput
(the many small packets resulting from fragmentation doesn't affect the number of packets
received by the UDP application, because they are defragmented by the MAC before they arrive
at the UDP app).

Let's look at the details of the four configurations. Here is ``DCFnofrag`` from
:download:`omnetpp.ini <../omnetpp.ini>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: DCFnofrag
   :end-at: fragmentationThreshold
   :language: ini

It just sets a fragmentation threshold higher than the packet size to avoid fragmentation.

In the next configuration, ``DCFfrag``, we turn on fragmentation. Here is the
configuration in :download:`omnetpp.ini <../omnetpp.ini>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: DCFfrag
   :end-at: fragmentationThreshold
   :language: ini

It sets a fragmentation threshold value smaller than the packet size.
Packets will be fragmented to 250-byte pieces. Each packet is followed
by an ACK and a contention period.

Next, we examine how performance is affected if the small packets are sent
during a TXOP, so the originator MAC doesn't have to contend for the channel
after transmitting each packet. In the next configuration, ``HCFfrag``,
the MAC will use HCF instead of DCF, and take advantage of video priority TXOP.
Here is the configuration in :download:`omnetpp.ini <../omnetpp.ini>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: HCFfrag
   :end-at: fragmentationThreshold
   :language: ini

It sets the same fragmentation threshold as the previous configuration.
QoS is enabled (so the MAC uses HCF). A classifier is added to sort packets
into the video priority category. Frame aggregation is turned off, because
we don't want to aggregate our fragments into a larger frame.

Packets are transmitted without contention during the TXOP, but all of them are ACKed
individually.

In the final configuration, ``HCFfragblockack``, we extend the previous configuration
and turn on block acks, so a group of packets can be ACKed.

When block acks are enabled, the sender node sends a block ack request after
transmitting a certain number of frames (by default, five). The receiver node
then sends a block ack, which contains information about which packets were
received correctly, and which weren't. The incorrectly received ones can be
retransmitted by the sender.

Here is the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: HCFfragblockack
   :end-at: isBlockAckSupported
   :language: ini

This configuration just enables block acks. The default block ack threshold is used,
i.e. block ack requests are sent after five frames.

Results
-------

Here are the results from the simulations:

.. figure:: media/numberofpackets.png
   :width: 90%
   :align: center

.. figure:: media/throughput.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

In our setup, the throughput is the lowest when packets are not fragmented
(``DFCnofrag`` line), because very few packets are received correctly.
Throughput improves considerably (by a factor of 20) when fragmentation
is turned on (``DCFfrag`` line). The use of TXOPs (``HCFfrag`` line) again brings
a two-fold increase in througput by eliminating contention periods.
The use of block ACKs (``HCFfragblockack`` line) brings another two-fold improvement.

Further Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We ran some parameter studies to examine the domain of effectiveness for
fragmentation. We based the parameter studies on the above simulations.
We examined the average application-level throughput. (The noise level,
transmission power, and other settings are the same as in the above
configurations unless otherwise noted.)

First, the iteration variable was the packet size (going from 100B to 2500B),
with a constant fragmentation threshold of 250 bytes:

.. figure:: media/onlypacketsize.png
   :width: 90%
   :align: center

Performance decreases with packet size in the ``DCFnofrag`` case, as larger packets
have more chance for becoming corrupted. In the cases where fragmentation is enabled,
the throughput follows a similar curve (increasing at the beginning, and fairly
constant after that). At small packet sizes, the 802.11 overhead is significant.
As the packet size increases above 1000B, throughput doesn't change substantially.
The difference in magnitude between the three curves of ``DCFfrag``, ``HCFfrag``,
and ``HCFfragblockack`` is due to the improvements of each configuration: the use
of TXOP increases throughput, and the use of TXOP + block acks increases it further.

Secondly, the fragmentation threshold was iterated, using a 1000-byte packet size:

.. figure:: media/threshold.png
   :width: 90%
   :align: center

The three curves are similar in shape to each other
in this case. The difference in magnitude between them can be attributed to the use
of TXOP and TXOP + block ack.

Next, the packet size was iterated, but on a wider range (from 100B to 6000B).
The MAC can fragment packets to a maximum of 16 fragments. Due to the larger
packets, the fragmentation threshold was set to around 1/16th of the packet size
(taking MAC headers into account), so that the MAC always fragments packets to 16 pieces.

.. figure:: media/packetsize.png
   :width: 90%
   :align: center

``DCFnofrag`` has an advantage when packets are small since fragmenting small packets
to 16 fragments entails a lot of overhead. Otherwise, the three curves where fragmentation
is enabled are similar, and the difference in magnitude is attributed to the use of TXOP
and TXOP + block ack.

Then, the transmission power was iterated to examine performance at different noise levels.

.. figure:: media/snir.png
   :width: 100%
   :align: center

It is apparent that in this scenario, the domain in which fragmentation is useful is
a very small range. Above a certain SNIR threshold, the fragmentation decreases performance,
and below another threshold, it doesn't make any difference because all packets are lost.

Try It Yourself
---------------

If you already have INET and OMNeT++ installed, start the IDE by typing
``omnetpp``, import the INET project into the IDE, then navigate to the
``inet/showcases/wireless/fragmentation`` folder in the `Project Explorer`. There, you can view
and edit the showcase files, run simulations, and analyze results.

Otherwise, there is an easy way to install INET and OMNeT++ using `opp_env
<https://omnetpp.org/opp_env>`__, and run the simulation interactively.
Ensure that ``opp_env`` is installed on your system, then execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env run inet-4.5 --init -w inet-workspace --install --build-modes=release --chdir \
       -c 'cd inet-4.5.*/showcases/wireless/fragmentation && inet'

This command creates an ``inet-workspace`` directory, installs the appropriate
versions of INET and OMNeT++ within it, and launches the ``inet`` command in the
showcase directory for interactive simulation.

Alternatively, for a more hands-on experience, you can first set up the
workspace and then open an interactive shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env install --init -w inet-workspace --build-modes=release inet-4.5
    $ cd inet-workspace
    $ opp_env shell

Inside the shell, start the IDE by typing ``omnetpp``, import the INET project,
then start exploring.
