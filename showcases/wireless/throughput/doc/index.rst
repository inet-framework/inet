IEEE 802.11 Throughput
======================

Goals
-----

This example analyzes how application-level throughput changes as a
function of nominal bitrate in an 802.11g network.

The model
---------

Application-level throughput
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

802.11 modes are denoted by the nominal data bitrate (e.g. 54 Mbps).
However, the bitrate available for an application is less than the
nominal bitrate because of protocol overhead like preambles, physical and
MAC headers, TCP and IP headers, interframe spaces, and backoff periods.
In this model, the actual application-level throughput is measured.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network contains two :ned:`WirelessHost`'s, at a distance of 1 meter,
one of them acting as a traffic source, the other one as a traffic sink. The
source host sends a UDP stream to the destination host in ad-hoc mode.
The simulation is run with a small packet size of 100 bytes, 1000 bytes, and the
default maximum unfragmented packet size in 802.11, 2236 bytes. (The
maximum transfer unit in 802.11 by default is 2304 bytes, which
corresponds to 2236 bytes of application data.) The simulation will be
run several times, with different bitrates. The UDP application in the
source host is configured to saturate the channel at all bitrates and
packet sizes. There will be no packets lost in the physical layer
because the hosts are close to each other, and the background noise is
configured to be very low.

The parameter study iterates over the following 802.11g bitrates: 6, 9,
12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 Mbps. Each simulation runs for 1 second, and
the UDP throughput is averaged for this interval.

   <!--
   Measured throughput is compared to analytically obtained values. The frame
   exchange duration can be calculated from the nominal bitrate and the payload
   size, for example using this <a href="https://sarwiki.informatik.hu-berlin.de/Packet_transmission_time_in_802.11" target="_blank">frame exchange
   duration calculation formula</a>. It takes the DIFS, data frame duration, SIFS and
   ACK duration into account (but not the backoff period.) By assuming an average
   backoff time that is half of the minimal contention window, the theoretical
   throughput can be calculated.

Throughput measured in the simulation is compared to analytically
obtained values. The application-level throughput can be calculated from
the nominal bitrate and the payload size, for example, using the excel sheet
`here <https://sarwiki.informatik.hu-berlin.de/Packet_transmission_time_in_802.11>`__.)
It takes the DIFS, data frame duration, SIFS, ACK duration, and backoff
period into account. It assumes an average backoff time that is half of
the minimal contention window to calculate the theoretical throughput:

-  ``throughput`` = 1 / ``frameExchangeDuration`` \* ``payloadLength``
   \* 8 [bps]

-  where ``frameExchangeDuration`` = ``DIFS`` + ``backoffDuration`` +
   ``dataFrameDuration`` + ``SIFS`` + ``ACKFrameDuration``

-  and ``backoffDuration`` = ``minContentionWindow`` / 2 \* ``slotTime``

The following plot compares the computed throughput to the results of
the simulation for all bitrates and both packet sizes:

The two curves match almost exactly. The curves are not linear:
throughput doesn't increase linearly with the bitrate, especially
at higher bitrates. The curve for the 2268-byte packets is nearly
linear, while the curve for the 100-byte packets is not linear because
the 100-byte packets have relatively more overhead due to various
protocol headers, such as UDP header and 802.11 MAC header. Also, faster
bitrates have more overhead. For example, with 1000-byte packets, at 6
Mbps the application-level throughput is 5 Mbps (16% overhead), whereas
at 54 Mbps it is only about 24.5 Mbps (54% overhead). Faster modes only
transmit the MAC header and content part of frames at higher bitrates,
the preamble, physical header, interframe spaces, and backoff stay the
same, thus the overhead gets larger as the bitrate increases.

The following sequence chart excerpt illustrates overhead increasing
with bitrate. It shows frame exchanges for 1000-byte UDP packets, with
bitrates of 6, 18, and 54 Mbps, on the same linear timescale. One can
see how the proportion of data parts shrinks compared to the duration of
the frame exchange as bitrates increase.

The following sequence chart illustrates the relative sizes of the
preamble, physical header, and data part of a 54 Mbps frame exchange.
The preamble and the physical header have the same duration regardless of
the bitrate, further increasing overhead at higher bitrates.

There are techniques that increase application-level throughput by
reducing overhead. For example, in 802.11n, overhead at high bitrates is
reduced by using block acknowledgment and frame aggregation. When block
acknowledgment is used, multiple data frames can be acknowledged with a
single block acknowledgment frame (instead of ACKing each data frame
one-by-one.) Frame aggregation allows multiple data frames to be sent
following a preamble and a physical header in a single transmission.
Recent versions of the INET Framework support these 802.11 features, but
they are out of scope for this simulation example.
