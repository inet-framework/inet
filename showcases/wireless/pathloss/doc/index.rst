Path Loss Models
================

Goals
-----

Path loss models are used to represent the loss of signal strength over distance
in wireless communication. INET has a range
of path loss models available, including simple models like free space path loss
and more complex ones like Rician and Rayleigh fading.

This showcase demonstrates how to use path loss models in simulations and
it also compares the received power at different distances using different path
loss models.

About path loss models
----------------------

Path loss models are used to compute the decrease in the power of a
radio signal as it propagates away from the transmitter. Path loss
models are implemented by path loss modules, which are submodules of the
radio medium module. The default path loss model is most often free
space path loss, which computes attenuation according to the inverse
square law along a single line-of-sight propagation path. This is a
simple model, and realistic only in certain cases, e.g. when modeling
satellite-to-satellite communications. Because of its low computational
cost, it is also useful if the emphasis of the simulation is not on the
accuracy of radio propagation (e.g. for testing protocols.) However,
there are several more path loss models available in INET, suitable for
various other scenarios. Here is a list of the path loss module types
featured in this showcase example:

-  :ned:`FreeSpacePathLoss` computes the loss of signal power in a single
   line-of-sight propagation path, without any reflections or shadowing.
-  :ned:`TwoRayGroundReflection` computes the loss of signal power by assuming
   a line-of-sight wave interfering with another wave reflected from the
   ground between the transmitter and the receiver. This model computes
   interference in the far-field only and is the same as free space
   path loss up until a certain crossover distance.
-  :ned:`TwoRayInterference` is the same as the two-ray ground
   reflection model in the far-field, but it models the interference of
   the two waves in the near-field as well.
-  :ned:`RicianFading` is a stochastic path loss model that assumes a
   dominant line-of-sight signal and multiple reflected signals between
   the transmitter and the receiver. It is useful for modeling radio
   propagation in an urban environment.
-  :ned:`LogNormalShadowing` is a stochastic path loss model where
   power levels follow a lognormal distribution. It is useful for
   modeling shadowing caused by objects such as trees.

Other path loss modules in INET include :ned:`RayleighFading`,
:ned:`NakagamiFading`, :ned:`UwbIrStochasticPathLoss`, :ned:`BreakpointPathLoss`,
and :ned:`SuiPathLoss`.

The various path loss modules each have sets of parameters to fine-tune
their behavior. In this showcase, we leave the parameters at their
defaults.

The model
---------

The study will involve two wireless hosts that communicate at a varying
distance. For each distance and path loss model, a probe packet will be
sent from one host to the other, and the signal's received power will be
recorded.

In addition to the two hosts named ``source`` and ``destination``,
the network also contains a :ned:`PhysicalEnvironment` module, an
:ned:`Ipv4NetworkConfigurator`, and a :ned:`Ieee80211RadioMedium`:

.. todo::

   rewrite when the two-ray interference model is modified to use the ground model if there is one

The antenna height of the transmitter and the receiver is an important
part of the two-ray ground reflection and two-ray interference models
because the antenna heights affect path loss. The two-ray interference
model calculates antenna heights from the z co-ordinates of the two
nodes by assuming the z co-ordinate of the ground to be 0. The two-ray
ground reflection model needs a ground model, which contains the
elevation of the ground. The ground model is part of the physical
environment module. By default, the physical environment module doesn't
use a ground model, but it is set in the configuration to use
:ned:`FlatGround`:

``*.physicalEnvironment.groundType = "FlatGround"``

We will leave the ground's elevation parameter at default, which is 0.
The z co-ordinate of both hosts is set to 2 meters, thus both antennas
are 2 meters above the ground. (The hosts have isotropic antennas, which
lack directionality.)

The simulation is a parameter study, where ``source`` is configured to
send a UDP packet to ``destination``. One of the parameters of the study
is the distance between the hosts (the x co-ordinate of
``destination's`` position.) The distance changes from 0 to 1000 meters.
It changes with smaller steps near 0, where the change in power will be
more rapid.

Here are the keys from the configuration relevant for positioning the
hosts:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :start-at: initFromDisplayString
   :end-at: destination.mobility.initialX
   :language: ini

The other variable in the parameter study is the path loss type, which
takes on the following values: :ned:`FreeSpacePathLoss`,
:ned:`TwoRayGroundReflection`, :ned:`TwoRayInterference`, :ned:`RicianFading`,
:ned:`LogNormalShadowing`.

The source host will transmit with the default power of 20mW. We will
record the power of the received transmission, using the
``receptionPower`` statistic. The ``receptionPower`` statistic is
declared in the NED file, and it uses the ``receptionMinSignalPower``
signal of the radio medium module as input:

.. literalinclude:: ../PathLossShowcase.ned
   :language: ned
   :start-at: statistic
   :end-before: submodules

Results
-------

The power of the received signal vs. distance, using
:ned:`FreeSpacePathLoss`, :ned:`TwoRayGroundReflection`, and
:ned:`TwoRayInterference` path loss module types, is displayed on the
following plot:

.. figure:: media/tworay.png
   :width: 100%

Here is the same plot zoomed in:

.. figure:: media/tworay_zoomed.png
   :width: 100%

It is apparent that the two-ray ground reflection model yields the same
values as the free space path loss model, up until the cross-over
distance. After that point, the two curves diverge. The power of the
two-ray interference model fluctuates in the near-field and converges
to the two-ray ground reflection model in the far- field. Thus the
two-ray interference model can be used for more realistic two-ray
propagation simulations.

The next plot displays the power of the received signal vs. distance
using the :ned:`RicianFading` and :ned:`LogNormalShadowing` models, and the
:ned:`FreeSpacePathLoss` model for reference:

.. figure:: media/ricianlognormal.png
   :width: 100%

The sharp visual change in the "raggedness" of the curves near 100m is
due to the data points becoming less dense. Here is the same plot zoomed
in on the near-field:

Try It Yourself
---------------

If you already have INET and OMNeT++ installed, start the IDE by typing
``omnetpp``, import the INET project into the IDE, then navigate to the
``inet/showcases/wireless/pathloss`` folder in the `Project Explorer`. There, you can view
and edit the showcase files, run simulations, and analyze results.

Otherwise, there is an easy way to install INET and OMNeT++ using `opp_env
<https://omnetpp.org/opp_env>`__, and run the simulation interactively.
Ensure that ``opp_env`` is installed on your system, then execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env run inet-4.5 --init -w inet-workspace --install --build-modes=release --chdir \
       -c 'cd inet-4.5.*/showcases/wireless/pathloss && inet'

This command creates an ``inet-workspace`` directory, installs the appropriate
versions of INET and OMNeT++ within it, and launches the ``inet`` command in the
showcase directory for interactive simulation.

Alternatively, for a more hands-on experience, you can first set up the
workspace and then open an interactive shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ opp_env install --init -w inet-workspace --build-modes=release inet-4.5
    $ cd inet-workspace
    $ opp_env shell

Inside the shell, start the IDE by typing ``omnetpp``, import the INET project,
then start exploring.
