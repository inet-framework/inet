    # The following atrocity was necessitated by the timeout limits on Travis,
    # the fact that our debug builds are slow as heck, and the fingerprint test
    # runner script is suspected of not being entirely free of deadlocks.
    # The first 6 jobs are the release mode jobs, each runs a subset of the
    # fingerprint tests. The 6 after them are the same, except in debug mode.
    # The splitting is done with -x and -m expressions, quite arbitrarily,
    # to get subsets of roughly equivalent size. This might have to be adjusted
    # as the test suite evolves. Yes, the last two groups are split so that the tests
    # in one of them contain the letter 'v', and the ones in the other don't. So what.
