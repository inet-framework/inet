INET Framework for OMNEST/OMNeT++
=================================

The INET framework is an open-source communication networks simulation
package, written for the OMNEST/OMNeT++ simulation system. The INET framework
contains models for several Internet protocols: beyond TCP and IP there is UDP,
Ethernet, PPP and MPLS with LDP and RSVP-TE signalling. See the CREDITS file
for the names of people involved in the development.


GETTING STARTED
---------------
You may start by downloading and installing the INET demo on Windows.

Then you can gather initial experience by following the INET tutorial. After
that, you can learn the NED language from the OMNeT++ manual & sample
simulations.

After that, you may write your own topologies using the NED language. You may
assign some of the submodule parameters in NED files. You may leave some of
them unassigned.

Then, you may assign unassigned module parameters in omnetpp.ini of your
simulation. (You can refer to sample simulations & manual for the content of
omnetpp.ini)

Finally, you will be ready to run your simulation. As you see, you may use
the INET framework without writing any C++ code, as long as you use the
available modules.

Finally, to implement new protocols or modify existing ones, you'll need to
download the INET source, compile it yourself, then start adding/modifying
source files yourself.
