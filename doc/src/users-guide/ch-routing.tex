\chapter{Internet Routing}
\label{cha:routing}

\section{Overview}

INET Framework has models for several internet routing protocols, including
RIP, OSPF and BGP.

The easiest way to add routing to a network is to use the \nedtype{Router}
NED type for routers. \nedtype{Router} contains a conditional instance
for each of the above protocols. These submodules can be enabled by
setting the \ttt{hasRIP}, \ttt{hasOSPF} and/or \ttt{hasBGP} parameters to
\ttt{true}.

Example:

\begin{inifile}
**.hasRIP = true
\end{inifile}

There are also NED types called \nedtype{RipRouter}, \nedtype{OspfRouter},
\nedtype{BgpRouter}, which are all \nedtype{Router}s with appropriate
routing protocol enabled.

\section{RIP}
\label{sec:rip}

RIP (Routing Information Protocol) is a distance-vector routing protocol
which employs the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops
by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source
to destination.

The \nedtype{Rip} module implements distance vector routing as
specified in RFC 2453 (RIPv2) and RFC 2080 (RIPng). Per-interface
configuration can be specified in an XML file.

\nedtype{RipRouter} is a \nedtype{Router} with the RIP protocol enabled.


\section{OSPF}
\label{sec:ospf}

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) is a routing protocol for IP networks.
It uses a link state routing (LSR) algorithm and falls into the group
of interior gateway protocols (IGPs), operating within a single
autonomous system (AS).

The \nedtype{Ospf} module implements the OSPF Version 2. Areas and routers
can be configured using an XML file.

\nedtype{OspfRouter} is a \nedtype{Router} with the OSPF protocol enabled.


\section{BGP}
\label{sec:bgp}

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol
designed to exchange routing and reachability information among
autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet.

The \nedtype{Bgp} module implements BGP Version 4. The model implements
RFC 4271, with some limitations. Autonomous Systems and rules can be
configured in an XML file.

\nedtype{BgpRouter} is a \nedtype{Router} with the BGP protocol enabled.
