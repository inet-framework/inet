What is INET Framework
----------------------

The INET Framework is an open-source model library for the OMNeT++
simulation environment. Protocols, agents, and other models are provided
for researchers and students working with communication networks. INET
is especially useful for designing and validating new protocols or
exploring new or exotic scenarios.

A wide class of communication networks are supported by INET, including wired,
wireless, mobile, ad hoc, and sensor networks. Models for the
Internet stack (TCP, UDP, IPv4, IPv6, OSPF, BGP, etc.), link layer
protocols (Ethernet, PPP, IEEE 802.11, various sensor MAC protocols,
etc.), refined support for the wireless physical layer, MANET routing
protocols, DiffServ, MPLS with LDP and RSVP-TE signaling, several
application models, and many other protocols and components are included. Support is also
provided for node mobility, advanced visualization, network
emulation, and more.

INET serves as a base for several other simulation frameworks which extend it
into specific directions, such as vehicular networks,
overlay/peer-to-peer networks, or LTE.

Designed for Experimentation
----------------------------

INET is built around the concept of modules that communicate through message
passing. Components represent agents and network protocols,
which can be freely combined to form hosts, routers, switches, and other
networking devices. Users can program new components, and
existing components are designed to be easy to
understand and modify.

INET benefits from the infrastructure provided by OMNeT++. In addition to making
use of the services provided by the OMNeT++ simulation kernel and
library (component model, parameterization, result recording, etc.),
models can be developed, assembled, parameterized,
run, and their results evaluated from the comfort of the OMNeT++
Simulation IDE or from the command line.

INET Framework is maintained by the OMNeT++ team for the community,
utilizing patches and new models contributed by members of the
community.

Scope of this Manual
--------------------

This manual is written for users who are interested in assembling
simulations using the components provided by the INET Framework. (In
contrast, if one is interested in modifying INETâ€™s components or plans to
extend INET with new protocols or other components using C++, the
*INET Developers Guide* is recommended.)

This manual does not attempt to be a reference for INET. It focuses
on conveying the big picture and does not attempt to cover all
components or try to document the parameters, gates, statistics, or
precise operation of individual components. For such information, users
should refer to the *INET Reference*, a web-based cross-referenced
documentation generated from NED and MSG files.

A working knowledge of OMNeT++ is assumed.
