Network Emulation
=================

.. _ug:sec:emulation:motivation:

Motivation
----------

In INET, the term *emulation* is used in a broad sense to describe a system which
is partially implemented in the real world and partially in simulation.
Emulation is often utilized for testing and validating a simulation model with
its real-world counterparts, or in a reverse scenario, during the development
of a real-world protocol implementation or application, for testing in
a simulated environment. It may also be necessitated by the fact that
some parts of the system only exist in the real world or only as simulation
models.

.. Developing a protocol, a protocol implementation, or an application that heavily
   relies on network communication is often more practical, less expensive,
   and safer using simulation than directly performing experiments in the real world.
   However, there are potential pitfalls: porting simulation code to the target device
   may incur high costs and be error-prone, and also, a model that performs well in simulation
   does not necessarily work equally well when deployed in the real world.
   INET helps mitigate these risks by allowing the researcher to mix
   simulation and the real world in various ways, thereby reducing the need for porting,
   and offering more possibilities for testing the code.

.. There are several projects that may benefit from the network emulation
   capabilities of INET, that is, from the ability to mix simulated
   components with real networks. **todo** not just networks

INET provides modules that act as bridges between the
simulated and real domains; hence, it is possible to leave one part
of the simulation unchanged, while simply extracting the other into the
real world. Several setups are possible where one can take advantage of the emulation
capabilities of INET:

- simulated node in a real network
- a simulated subnet in a real network
- real-world node in a simulated network
- simulated protocol in a real network node
- real application in a simulated network node
- etc.

Some example scenarios:

-  A simulated component, such as an app or a routing protocol, can be run
   on nodes of an actual ad-hoc network. This setup would allow testing the
   behavior of the component under real-life conditions.

-  The interoperability of a simulated protocol with its real-world
   counterparts can be tested.

.. Several setups are possible: simulated node in a real
   network; a simulated subnet in a real network; real-world node in
   simulated network; etc.

-  As a means of implementing hybrid simulation, the real network (or a
   single host OS) may contain several network emulator devices or
   simulations running in emulation mode. Such a setup provides a
   relatively easy way of connecting heterogeneous simulators/emulators
   with each other, eliminating the need for HLA or a custom
   interoperability solution.

.. _ug:sec:emulation:overview:

Overview
--------

For the simulation to act as a network emulator, two major problems need to be solved.
On one hand, the simulation must run in real time, or the real clock must be
configured according to the simulation time (synchronization). On the
other hand, the simulation must be able to communicate with the real
world (communication). This is achieved in INET as follows:

- Synchronization:

  - ``RealTimeScheduler:`` It is a socket-aware real-time
    scheduler class responsible for synchronization. Using this method, the
    simulation is run according to real time.

- Communication:

   -  The interface between the real (an interface of the OS) and the
      simulated parts of the model is represented by `Ext` modules,
      with names beginning with the ``Ext~`` prefix in the
      simulation (``ExtLowerUdp``, ``ExtUpperEthernetInterface``,
      etc.).

      Ext modules communicate both internally in the simulation and externally in the host OS.
      Packets sent to these modules in the simulation will be sent out on the host
      OS interface, and packets received by the host OS interface (or
      rather, the appropriate subset of them) will appear in the
      simulation as if received on an ``Ext~`` module.


      There are several possible ways to maintain the external communication:

      -  File
      -  Pipe
      -  Socket
      -  Shared memory
      -  TUN/TAP interfaces
      -  Message Passing Interface (MPI)

.. To act as a network emulator, the simulation must run in real time, and
   must be able to communicate with the real world.

   This is achieved with two components in INET:

  -  :ned:`ExtLowerEthernetInterface` is an INET network interface that
     represents a real interface (an interface of the host OS) in the simulation.
     Packets sent to an :ned:`ExtLowerEthernetInterface` will be sent out on the
     host OS interface, and packets received by the host OS interface (or
     rather, the appropriate subset of them) will appear in the simulation
     as if received on an :ned:`ExtLowerEthernetInterface`. The code uses
     raw sockets for sending and receiving packets.

  -  :cpp:`RealTimeScheduler`, a socket-aware real-time scheduler class.

.. note::

   It is probably needless to say, but the simulation must be fast enough
   to be able to keep up with real time. That is, its relative speed compared
   to real time (the simsec/sec value) must be >>1.  (Under Qtenv, this
   can usually only be achieved in Express mode.)

.. _ug:sec:emulation:preparation:

Preparation
-----------

There are a few things that need to be arranged before simulations can
be successfully run in network emulation mode.

First, network emulation is a separate *project feature* that needs to
be enabled before it can be used. (Project features can be reviewed and
changed in the *Project \| Project Features...* dialog in the IDE.)

.. Also, when running a simulation, make sure you have the necessary
   permissions. Sending and receiving packets rely on raw sockets
   (type ``SOCK_RAW``), which, on many systems, is only allowed for
   processes that have root (administrator) privileges.

Also, in order to be able to send packets through raw sockets,
applications require special permissions. There
are two ways to achieve this under Linux.

The suggested solution is to use setcap to set the application
permissions:

.. code::

   $ sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /path/to/opp_run
   $ sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /path/to/opp_run_dbg
   $ sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /path/to/opp_run_release

This solution makes running the examples from the IDE possible.
Alternatively, the application can be started with root privileges from
the command line:


.. code::

   $ sudo `inet_dbg -p -u Cmdenv`

.. note:: In any case, it's generally a bad idea to start the IDE as superuser.
          Doing so may silently change the file ownership for certain IDE
          configuration files, and it may prevent the IDE from starting up for the
          normal user afterwards.

.. _ug:sec:emulation:configuring:

Configuring
-----------

Here we demonstrate one configuration example where the network nodes contain
a :ned:`ExtLowerEthernetInterface`.

INET nodes such as :ned:`StandardHost` and :ned:`Router` can be
configured to have :ned:`ExtLowerEthernetInterface`s. The simulation
may contain several nodes with external interfaces, and one node may
also have several external interfaces.

.. note::

   This is one of the many possible setups. Using other components than
   :ned:`ExtLowerEthernetInterface`, nodes may be split into simulated and real
   parts at any layer, and either the upper or the lower part may be real.
   See the Showcases for demonstration of some of these use cases.

A network node can be configured to have an external interface in the
following way:

.. code-block:: ini

   **.host1.numEthInterfaces = 1
   **.host1.eth[0].typename = "ExtLowerEthernetInterface"

Also, the simulation must be configured to run under the control of the
appropriate real-time scheduler class:

.. code-block:: ini

   scheduler-class = "inet::RealTimeScheduler"

:ned:`ExtLowerEthernetInterface` has two important parameters that need
to be configured. The :par:`device` parameter should be set to the name
of the real (or virtual) interface on the host OS. The :par:`namespace`
parameter can be set to utilize the network namespace functionality of
Linux operating systems.

An example configuration:

.. code-block:: ini

   **.numEthInterfaces = 1
   **.eth[0].device = "veth0" # or "eth0" for example
   **.eth[0].namespace = "host0" # optional
   **.eth[0].mtu = 1500B

.. .. note::

Let us examine the paths outgoing and incoming packets take and the
necessary configuration requirements to make them work. We assume IPv4
as network layer protocol, but the picture does not change much with
other protocols. We assume the external interface is named
``eth[0]``.

Outgoing path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The network layer of the simulated node routes datagrams to its
``eth[0]`` external interface.

For that to happen, the routing table needs to contain an entry where
the interface is set to ``eth[0]``. Such entries are not created
automatically; one needs to add them to the routing table explicitly,
e.g. by using an :ned:`Ipv4NetworkConfigurator` and an appropriate XML
file.

Another point is that if the packet comes from a local app (and from
another simulated node), it needs to have a source IP address assigned.
There are two ways for that to happen. If the sending app specified a
source IP address, that will be used. Otherwise, the IP address of the
``eth[0]`` interface will be used, but for that, the interface needs
to have an IP address at all. The MAC and IP address of external interfaces
are automatically copied between the real and simulated counterparts.

Once in ``eth[0]``, the datagram is serialized. Serialization is a
built-in feature of INET packets. (Packets, or rather, packet chunks
have multiple alternative representations, i.e. C++ object and
serialized form, and conversion between them is transparent.)

The result of serialization is a byte array, which is written into a
raw socket with a ``sendto`` system call.

The packet will then travel normally in the real network to the
destination address.

Incoming path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First of all, packets intended to be received by the simulation need to
find their way to the correct interface of the host that runs the
simulation. For that, IP addresses of simulated hosts must be routable
in the real network and routed to the selected interface of the host
OS. (On Linux, for example, this can be achieved by adding static routes
with the command.)

As packets are received by the interface of the host OS, they are handed
over to the simulation. The packets are received from the raw socket with a
``recv`` system call. After deserialization, they pop out of ``eth[0]`` and
they are sent up to the network layer. The packets are routed to the simulated
destination host in the normal way.
