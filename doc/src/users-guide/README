How to build the manual
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------

Linux:

1. Install the 'texlive' package

2a. You may install the 'texlive-science' package, however recent distros still contain
    old 1.x versions of the bytefield package so the buil process may not work.
    (we need 2.x version)

2b. Install the bytefield package manually into a local folder:
    - copy the texmf folder in this directory to your $HOME dir
    - change to your $HOME dir and execute 'texhash texmf'

Windows:

1. Install MiKTex from miktex.org. The "basic" package is enough.
   (pdflatex will download needed extra packages automatically when you
   first build the document).

2. Install Inkscape. It will be used for SVG editing as well as for
   SVG-to-PNG and SVG-to-PDF conversion.


Making PDF output
-----------------
Make sure that <MiKTeX>/miktex/bin is in the path, then type "make pdf".


Graphics
--------
See http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/reference/figures.html

Screenshots and other raster images should be checked in as PNG, and included
in the LaTeX sources like this:

  \includegraphics[width=60mm]{myfig.png}
  \includegraphics[height=60mm]{myfig.jpg}
  \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{myfig.pdf}
  \includegraphics[angle=45,width=52mm]{myfig.jpg}

Vector graphics should be drawn and checked in in SVG format. This will be
rasterized to PNG (for HTML output) and exported as vector PDF (for PDF output)
using Inkscape command-line options:

  inkscape -e FILENAME  (or --export-png=FILENAME)
  inkscape -A FILENAME  (or --export-pdf=FILENAME)

See http://inkscape.modevia.com/inkscape-man.html for other options (e.g.
-w/-h for specifying bitmap dimensions in pixels).
