\section{What is INET Framework}

INET Framework contains IPv4, IPv6, TCP, SCTP, UDP protocol implementations,
and several application models. The framework also includes an MPLS model
with RSVP-TE and LDP signalling. Link-layer models are PPP, Ethernet and 802.11.
Static routing can be set up using network autoconfigurators, or one can use
routing protocol implementations. The INET Framework supports wireless and
mobile simulations as well.


\section{About the documentation}

This manual is accompanied by a Reference generated from NED and MSG files using
OMNeT++'s documentation generator, and the documentation of the underlying C++ classes,
generated from the source files using Doxygen.

The C++ doc is generated in a way that it contains the full C++ source code
as HTML pages. It is syntax highlighted, and variable and class names are hyperlinked
and cross-referenced, which makes it convenient for exploring the code.
