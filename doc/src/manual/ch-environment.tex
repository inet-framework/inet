\chapter{The Physical Environment}
\label{cha:environment}

\section{Overview}

Todays wireless communication networks are heavily affected by their physical
environment. Mobile networks operate in densely built urban areas, wireless
networks work inside large buildings, low power wireless sensors communicate
in industrial environments, batteries operate in various external conditions,
and so on.

The propagation of communication signals, the movement of communicating agents,
or battery exhaustion depend on the surrounding physical environment. For
example, signals can be absorbed by objects, can pass through objects, can be
refracted by surfaces, can be reflected from surfaces, etc. These effects cannot
be ignored in high fidelity simulations.

The physical environment model is separated from the rest of the communication
related models. It's main goal is to describe buildings, walls, vegetation,
terrain, weather and other physical conditions that might have effect on signal
propagation, movement, batteries, etc. The separation makes the model reusable
by other simulation models that depend on these circumstances.

This chapter provides a brief overview of the physical environment model. 

\section{Physical Objects}

The most important aspect of the physical environment is the objects which are
present in it. For example, simulating an indoor wifi scenario needs to model
walls, floors, ceilings, doors, windows, furniture, etc. Most of these objects
have very basic shapes and homogeneous materials. So the physical object model
has the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \ttt{shape}: describes the 3D shape of the object independently of its
position and orientation
  \item \ttt{position}: determines where the object is located in the 3D space
  \item \ttt{orientation}: determines how the object is rotated relative to its
default orientation
  \item \ttt{material}: describes various material specific physical properties  
  \item \ttt{graphical properties}: provides parameters for better visualization
\end{itemize}

The physical objects are also mostly immobile. In the current model they cannot
change their position or orientation over time.

Since the shape of the physical objects might be quite diverse, the model is
designed to be extensible with new shapes. Concave shapes are not yet supported,
such shapes should be split up into convex parts. The current implementation
provides the following convex shapes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \cppclass{Sphere}: specified by a radius 
  \item \cppclass{Cuboid}: specified by a length, a width, and a height
  \item \cppclass{Prism}: specified by a 2 dimensional polygon base and a height
  \item \cppclass{Polyhedron}: specified by a set of 3 dimensional vertices
\end{itemize}

In order to model the physical environment in detail a scenario might contain
several thousands or even more physical objects. Other simulation models might
need to query these objects quite often. For example, when the physical layer
computes obstacle loss for a transmission, it needs to find the obstructing
physical objects for each receiver. This requires computing the intersection
between physical objects and the path traveled by the signal. For this purpose,
the physical environment supports storing physical objects in one of the
following efficient cache data structures:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \nedtype{GridObjectCache}: organizes objects into a spatial grid with
a configurable constant cell size, cells contain those objects that intersect
with them
  \item \nedtype{BVHObjectCache}: organizes objects into a tree data structure,
tree leaves contain a configurable number of closely positioned objects
\end{itemize}

\iffalse TODO: the implementation is either incomplete or unused yet
\section{Physical Properties}

The physical environment also provides certain global physical properties such
as the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \ttt{space limits}: constraints for physical objects, signal propagation
and movement 
  \item \ttt{temperature}: might have effects on battery models 
\end{itemize}

\section{Initialization}

In order to easily define thousands of physical objects the model needs to use a
flexible and concise representation. For this purpose, the physical environment
provides an XML file format. This file can be used to define reusable shapes,
reusable materials, and physical objects. The following example demonstrates the
XML file format:

\begin{verbatim}
<environment>
  <!-- defines a sphere shape -->
  <shape id="1" type="sphere" radius="10"/>
  <!-- defines a cuboid shape -->
  <shape id="2" type="cuboid" size="20 30 40"/>
  <!-- defines a prism (e.g. a cube) shape -->
  <shape id="3" type="prism" height="100"
         points="0 0 100 0 100 100 0 100"/>
  <!-- defines a polyhedron (e.g. a cube) shape -->
  <shape id="4" type="polyhedron"
         points="0 0 0 100 0 0 100 100 0 0 100 0 ..."/>
  <!-- defines a material -->
  <material id="1" resistivity="100"
            relativePermittivity="4.5" relativePermeability="1"/>
  <!-- defines an object using the previously defined shapes and materials -->
  <object position="min 100 200 0" orientation="45 -30 0"
          shape="1" material="1"
          line-color="0 0 0" fill-color="112 128 144" opacity="0.5"/>
  <!-- defines another object similar to the previous one
       using an inline shape and a predefined material -->
  <object position="min 100 200 0" orientation="45 -30 0"
          shape="cuboid 20 30 40" material="concrete"
          line-color="0 0 0" fill-color="112 128 144" tags="Building"/>
</environment>          
\end{verbatim}

For more details on the XML file format please refer to the documentation in the
\nedtype{PhysicalEnvironment} NED file.

\section{Visualization}

Understanding the abstract physical environment model from numerical log output
or debugging other simulation models based on the numerical data structures
is difficult. Therefore the physical environment supports visualizing the
physical objects on the graphical user interface. The visualization is done by
drawing the physical objects on the parent compound module as a separate layer. 
In order to help distinguish among physical objects they have the following 
graphical properties:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \ttt{line width}: surface outline 
  \item \ttt{line color}: surface outline
  \item \ttt{fill color}: surface filling 
  \item \ttt{opacity}: surface outline and filling
  \item \ttt{tags}: allows filtering objects on the graphical user interface
\end{itemize}

Although the physical objects are really modeled in 3 dimensions, the
visualization is only 2 dimensional. The projection which converts physical
objects to 2 dimensional shapes can be parameterized with an arbitrary view
angle. The default view angle is the Z axis, in which case the layer shows the
physical objects from above. The view angle can be changed during runtime using
the parameter editor of the graphical user interface.

The projection is also used by other models for their own visualizations. This
approach makes visualizations well integrated with each other. For example, the
mobility models position network nodes, the physical layer draws ongoing
transmissions, the obstacle loss draws intersections, etc. on the canvas
according to the projection described above.
