\label{cha:ipv6}


\section{Overview}

IPv6 support is implemented by several cooperating modules. The IPv6 module
implements IPv6 datagram handling (sending, forwarding etc). It relies on
\nedtype{RoutingTable6} to get access to the routes. \nedtype{RoutingTable6} also contains the
neighbour discovery data structures (destination cache, neighbour cache,
prefix list -- the latter effectively merged into the route table). Interface
configuration (address, state, timeouts etc) is held in the \nedtype{InterfaceTable},
in \cppclass{IPv6InterfaceData} objects attached to \cppclass{InterfaceEntry}
as its \ttt{ipv6()} member.

The module \nedtype{IPv6NeighbourDiscovery} implements all tasks associated with
neighbour discovery and stateless address autoconfiguration. The data
structures themselves (destination cache, neighbour cache, prefix list)
are kept in \nedtype{RoutingTable6}, and are accessed via public C++ methods.
Neighbour discovery packets are only sent and processed by this module --
when IPv6 receives one, it forwards the packet to \nedtype{IPv6NeighbourDiscovery}.

The rest of ICMPv6 (ICMP errors, echo request/reply etc) is implemented in
the module \nedtype{ICMPv6}, just like with IPv4. ICMP errors are sent into
\nedtype{IPv6ErrorHandling}, which the user can extend or replace to get errors
handled in any way they like.
