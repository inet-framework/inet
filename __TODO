INET 4.5 release TODO items:

1. Implementation

 - refactor all quantity formatting to use the OMNeT++ 6.1 quantity formatter (e.g. 160000000 Hz -> 160 MHz)
   - replace long2string and double2string in Units.msg

 - python support for running simulations/tests/etc. using OMNeT++ 6.1 which should contain the necessary python support

 - Determining the next protocol for a packet in a protocol module using DispatchProtocolReq and EncapsulationProtocolReq. #782

 - Restructure StandardHost to make it flexible enough to replace all current network node types which are basically copied from StandardHost and slightly modified
   - use @reconnect to simplify network nodes which copy big parts of StandardHost
   - revise all network node module base class hierarchy (e.g. mpls nodes)

 - Restructure StandardHost to include a separate LLC layer which contains:
   - a separate packet classifier (LlcClassifier) that decides which LLC is used (if any) based on the MAC protocol for example
   - IEEE 802.2 SNAP LLC
   - IEEE 802 EPD LLC
   - ZIGBEE LLC (https://lucidar.me/en/zigbee/autopsy-of-a-zigbee-frame/)

 - replace findPathStartGate/findPathEndGate with findConnectedModule/findConnectedGate and wrap the type specific reference to the module/gate into a template class?

 - ??? synchronous packet processing vs message based configuration (e.g. sockets/interfaces)?

 - ??? refactor protocol modules to avoid cross module zero simulation time messaging using the FES
   - for example (App, Udp, Ipv4, Ethernet stack) two hosts one sending to the other, one packet send is 4 distinct events (transmission start/end and reception start/end),
     first event starts in App and ends with transmission start, next event is reception start, etc.

 - chunk queue and various chunk buffers don't have region tags, there's no place to store data specific tags from packets when reassembling data

 - fragmentation/defragmentation, aggregation/deaggregation must take care of packet/chunk tags and region tags properly

 - when deleting a network interface or deleting a network node, the interface deleted signal is missing

 - Qtenv packet log support via packet tags using INET modules similar to visualizers that hook into protocols
   - following wireless communication is almost impossible in the packet log
   - add filtering for technical/physical/link/network/transport/application levels (link should be the default)
   - support following TCP streams
