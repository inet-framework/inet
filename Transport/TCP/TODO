* currently, TCP does not transmit application's payload!

* Known bugs:
  - reaction of application when conn_estab_timeout in SYN_SENT
    (should not issue a CLOSE msg when TCP_I_CLOSED comes from tcp)
  - header should be saved in out-of-order queue
  - server does not accept SYN for new connection 
  ... there are others but I do not remember them now (it's late).

* Code restructuring:
  - TcpTcb should be implemented as a C++ class.
  - file tcpmodule.cc is very large (> 5000 lines of code). It should
    be split into more files - but the FSM should not be changed.

* TCP features
  - correct implementation of duplicateAck tests (5 criterias of
    Stevens:TCP/IP illustrated)
  - Implementation of fast rexmt and fast recovery (Keep in mind: only
    one packet from retransQ, then normal continue!)
  - A socket implementation that fits to the ip suite.
