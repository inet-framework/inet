in @to-be-processed-vars.txtthere is a list of INET module classes along with their state variables. 

REMOVE all variables that:
- that are configuration
- that are not changing during the runtime (i.e. they are just initialized at the beginning)
- that are pointers or references to other modules or classes
- has type of simsignal_t

KEEP variables that:
- represent addresses or IDs
- refer to Queues or data tables
- represent counters
- represent states (i.e. enums)

For each remaining variables, update their description in th file
- For each variable assign a single lower case letter code which is UNIQUE in that class
- Keep the one letter code consistent across modules if possible
- format: name: type - assigned code
