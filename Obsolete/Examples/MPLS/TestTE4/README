This is a example of traffic rerouting.

After the LSP was established from host1 to host3, there is a change
in the network resources. The delay of the link between LSR2 and LSR1 drops. 
This triggers CSPF to recalculate a more optimal path. A new LSP path is 
set up and traffic is rerouted from the old LSP path to the new LSP path.

This is an example of "make-before-break" technique used in RSVP-TE for 
traffic rerouting.

<traffic>

<conn>
  <src>10.0.0.1</src>
  <dest>10.0.1.2</dest>
  <setupPri>7</setupPri>
  <holdingPri>7</holdingPri>
  <bandwidth>100</bandwidth>
  <delay>0.005</delay>
</conn>

</traffic>
