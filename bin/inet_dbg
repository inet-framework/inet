# This script is intended to run INET simulations in debug mode. It can be used
# only after the 'setenv' script has been run from both the OMNeT++ and the INET
# top level directory using the '. setenv' command. To run a simulation, simply
# go into its directory and run 'inet_dbg' possibly passing additional command
# line arguments. Please note that both OMNeT++ and INET must be compiled in debug
# mode using 'make MODE=debug' before. Please also note that this script doesn't
# start the debugger, there are other scripts for that purpose.
