	* integrated Ahmed Ayadi's patch into the INET Fw, and ported to 
	  OMNeT++ 4.0; some cleanup

	* refactoring: 
	  - use C99 integer types (uint8_t etc) instead of u_int8_t
	  - converted some classes to msg files (all messages used to be
	    hand-coded C++ classes)
	  - renamed RTPEndsystemModule to RTP, RTCPEndsystemModule to RTCP

	* more work needed, see todo files
