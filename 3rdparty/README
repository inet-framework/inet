Place 3rd party libraries and software here. Some components of the INET
Framework expect to find their external components here.

Supported software:

- Network Simulation Cradle (real-world TCP implementations from Linux/OpenBSD/FreeBSD/lwIP)

  Download NSC from: http://www.wand.net.nz/~stj2/nsc/

  Extract the 'nsc-0.5.1.tar.bz2' tarball in this directory and build it.

  $ tar xvfj nsc-0.5.1.tar.bz2
  $ cd nsc-0.5.1
  $ python scons.py

  This should generate libfreebsd5.3.so, liblinux2.6.10.so, liblinux2.6.18.so,
  liblinux2.6.26.so, liblwip.so, libopenbsd3.5.so in the nsc-0.5.1 directory.

  Then rebuild INET.

  $ make cleanall
  $ make makefiles
  $ make

  To test if your build was correct, try the examples/inet/tcpclientserver
  example, and choose a configuration which uses NSC as the TCP implementation.
