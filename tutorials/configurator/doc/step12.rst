Step 12. Mixing different kinds of autorouting
==============================================

Goals
-----

Sometimes it is best to configure different parts of a network according
to different metrics. This step demonstrates using the hop count and
error rate metrics in a mixed wired/wireless network.

The model
---------

This step uses the :ned:`ConfiguratorE` network, defined in
:download:`ConfiguratorE.ned <../ConfiguratorE.ned>`. The network
looks like this:

.. figure:: media/step12network.png
   :width: 100%

The core of the network is composed of three routers connected to each
other, each belonging to an area. There are three areas, each containing
a number of hosts, connected to the area router.

-  Area1 is composed of three ``WirelessHosts``, one of which is
   connected to the router with a wired connection.
-  Area2 has an :ned:`AccessPoint` and three ``WirelessHosts``.
-  Area3 has three ``StandardHosts`` connected to the router via a
   switch.

There is no access point in area 1; the hosts form an ad-hoc wireless
network. They connect to the rest of the network through ``area1host3``,
which has a wired connection to the router. However, ``area1host3`` is
not in the communication range of ``area1host1`` (illustrated on the
image below.) Thus, ``area1host2`` needs to be configured to forward
``area1host1``'s packets to ``area1host3``. The error rate metric,
rather than the hop count, is best suited to configure routes in this LAN.
Routes in the rest of the network can be configured properly based on
the hop count metric.

The configuration for this step in omnetpp.ini is the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step12
   :end-before: ####

Explanation:

-  For hosts in area 1 to operate in ad-hoc mode, IP forwarding is
   turned on, and their management modules are set to ad-hoc management.
-  ``area1host1`` is configured to ping ``area2host1``, which is on the
   other side of the network.
-  Routes to all hosts and communication ranges are visualized.

The XML configuration in step12.xml is the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../step12.xml
   :language: xml

To have routes from every node to every other node, all nodes must be
covered by an autoroute element. The XML configuration contains two
autoroute elements. Routing tables of hosts in area 1 are configured
according to the error rate metric, while all others according to hop
count.

The global ``addStaticRoutes``, ``addDefaultRoutes`` and
``addSubnetRoutes`` parameters can also be specified per interface, with
attributes of the ``<interface>`` element. The attribute names are
``add-static-route``, ``add-default-route`` and ``add-subnet-route``,
and they are all booleans with true as the default value. The global and
per-interface settings are in a logical AND relationship, so both have
to be true to take effect.

The default route assumes there is one gateway, and all nodes on the
link can reach it directly. This is not the case for area 1 because
``area1host1`` is out of the range of the gateway host. The
``add-default-route`` parameter is set to false for the area 1 hosts.

Results
-------

The routes are visualized on the following image.

As intended, ``area1host1`` connects to the network via ``area1host2``.

The routing table of ``area1host1`` is as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   Node ConfiguratorF.area1host1
   -- Routing table --
   Destination      Netmask          Gateway          Iface             Metric
   10.0.0.1         255.255.255.255  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.2         255.255.255.255  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.5         255.255.255.255  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.6         255.255.255.255  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.9         255.255.255.255  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.10        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.18        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.28        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.33        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.34        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.41        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.16        255.255.255.248  *                wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.24        255.255.255.248  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.40        255.255.255.248  10.0.0.19        wlan0 (10.0.0.17)      0

The gateway is 10.0.0.19 (``area1host2``) in all rules, except in the
one where it is ``*``. That rule is for reaching the other hosts in the
LAN directly. This doesn't seem to be according to the error rate
metric, but the ``*`` rule matches destinations 10.0.0.18 and 10.0.0.19
only. Since 10.0.0.18 is covered by a previous rule, this one is
actually for reaching 10.0.0.19 directly.
