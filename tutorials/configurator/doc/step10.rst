Step 10. Configuring a completely wireless network
==================================================

Goals
-----

This step demonstrates using the error rate metric for configuring
static routes. It also demonstrates leaving the routing tables
unconfigured, so that a dynamic routing protocol can configure them. The step
consists of three parts:

-  **Part A**: Static routing based on the error rate metric
-  **Part B**: Unconfigured routing tables, prepared for MANET routing
-  **Part C**: Routing tables configured using AODV protocol

Part A: Static routing based on error rate metric
-------------------------------------------------

The topology of completely wireless networks is unclear in a static
analysis. By default, the configurator assumes all nodes can directly
talk to each other. When they can't, the error rate metric can be used
for automatic route configuration instead of the default hop count.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step uses the :ned:`ConfiguratorD` network, defined in
:download:`ConfiguratorD.ned <../ConfiguratorD.ned>`. The network
looks like this:

.. figure:: media/step10network.png
   :width: 100%

It contains seven ``AODVRouters`` laid out in a chain.

The configuration for this part in omnetpp.ini is the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step10A
   :end-before: ####

The transmitter power of radios determines their communication range. The
range is set up so that hosts are only in the range of the adjacent hosts in the
chain. :ned:`RoutingTableCanvasVisualizer` is set to visualize routes to
all destinations. The routing table visualization is simplified by
turning off arrow labels and setting the arrow line shift to 0. The
latter setting causes the visualizer to draw only one arrow between any
nodes even if there would be multiple arrows, e.g. one for both
directions (bi-directional routes will be displayed as bi-directional
arrows now.) Communication ranges of all hosts will be displayed.

The transmission power outside the communication range is below the
sensitivity of the receiving node, thus, the error rate is infinite.
However, the fact that the receiving host is within the communication
range circle doesn't mean that it can receive the transmission
correctly.

The XML configuration in step10a.xml is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../step10a.xml
   :language: xml

It contains a copy of the default address configurations, and an
<autoroute> element using the error rate metric. The configurator
calculates the packet error rate for a Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) sized
packet. Edge costs in the connectivity graph are assigned accordingly.

Results
~~~~~~~

Configured routes and communication ranges are displayed on the
following image. Error rate outside the communication range is infinite,
thus, all arrows are within the circles. Routes lead through adjacent
hosts in the chain. In each segment of the path, correct reception is
possible.

Part B: Unconfigured routing tables, prepared for MANET routing
---------------------------------------------------------------

Static routing is often not adequate in wireless networks, as the nodes
might move and the topology can change. Dynamic routing protocols can
react to these changes. When using dynamic protocols, the configurator
is only used to configure the addresses. It leaves the routing table
configuration to the dynamic protocol.

The configuration for this part in omnetpp.ini extends the one for Part A:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step10B
   :end-before: ####

The configurator is instructed to leave the routing tables empty, by
setting ``addStaticRoutes`` to false. The configurator just assigns the
addresses according to the default XML configuration.

The visualizer is still set to visualize all routes towards all
destinations.

Results

   :width: 100%

As instructed, the configurator didn't add any routes, as indicated by
the lack of arrows. The routing tables are empty.

Part C: Routing tables configured using AODV protocol
-----------------------------------------------------

In this part, routing tables are set up by the Ad-hoc On-demand Distance
Vector (AODV) dynamic routing protocol. The configuration for this part
extends Part B. The configuration in omnetpp.ini is the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step10C
   :end-before: ####

As specified in the previous part, the configurator is still instructed
not to add any routes. Also, the visualizer is still set to visualize
all routes. Additionally, ``host1`` is set to ping ``host2``. Since AODV
is a reactive routing protocol, the ping is required to trigger the AODV
protocol to set up routes.

Results
~~~~~~~

The routing tables are initially empty. The first ping packet triggers
AODV's route discovery process, which eventually configures the routes.
AODV is a reactive protocol, so unused routes expire after a while. This
happens to the routes to ``host2``, as it's not in the path between
``host1`` and ``host7``. This is displayed in the following video.

.. video:: media/step10C_4.mp4
   :width: 706
   :height: 650

To record the video, the simulation was run in fast mode, thus, routes
appear instantly. It takes a few seconds of simulation time for the unused
routes to expire.
