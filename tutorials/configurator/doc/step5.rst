Step 5. Manually overriding individual routes
=============================================

Goals
-----

Automatic configuration can fill the routing tables correctly, but
sometimes the user might want to manually override some of the routes.
This step consists of two parts:

-  In **Part A** we will override the routes to just one specific host
-  In **Part B** we will override routes to a set of hosts

Part A - Overriding routes to a specific host
---------------------------------------------

Both parts in this step use the :ned:`ConfiguratorA` network (displayed
below), just as in the previous steps. In this part, we will override the
routes going from the subnet of ``router0`` to ``host7``. With the
automatic configuration, packets from ``router0``'s subnet would go
through ``router2`` to reach ``host7`` (as in the previous step.) We
want them to go through ``router1`` instead.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration in omnetpp.ini is the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step5
   :end-before: ####

A ping application is added to ``host0``, in addition to the one in
``host1`` added in Step 4. The new app in ``host0`` pings ``host6`` to
demonstrate that only packets sent to ``host7`` are affected by the
route override.

For the routes to go through ``router1``, the routing table of
``router0`` has to be altered. The new rules should dictate that packets
with the destination of ``host7`` (10.0.0.35) should be routed towards
``router2``. The XML configuration in step5a.xml is the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../step5a.xml
   :language: xml

The ``<route>`` element describes a routing table entry for one or more
nodes in the network. The ``hosts`` optional selector attribute
specifies which hosts' routing tables should be affected. There are five
additional optional parameter attributes. These are the same as in real
life routing tables: ``address``, ``netmask``, ``gateway``,
``interface``, ``metric``.

The ``<route>`` element in this XML configuration adds the following
rule to ``router0``'s routing table: Packets with the destination of
10.0.0.35/32 should use the interface ``eth1`` and the gateway 10.0.0.18
(``router1``.) The concrete IP addresses were obtained by setting up the
network without the ``<route>`` element first and inspecting the
result.

Caveats
~~~~~~~

First, note that adding a route manually does not erase the original
route. Therefore, the new route will only take effect if it is
"stronger" than the automatically added one, for example, it has a longer
matching prefix, better metric, or (given the previous ones are equal)
occurs earlier in the routing table. Luckily, the last condition usually
holds (manually added routes are added at the top), so manually added
routes do take effect unless they are explicitly weaker than the
original ones.

Second, note that the ``<route>`` element refers to addresses (e.g.
10.0.0.35) which were automatically assigned by the ``<interface>``
element. It is valid to do so because the assignment of IP addresses is
deterministic, that is, given the same input, it will always produce the
same result. However, if you change the network topology, for example,
add, remove, or reorder hosts, addresses might be assigned in a different
way. The consequence may be that addresses in the ``<route>`` element no
longer exist in the modified network or they refer to different
hosts/routers than originally intended, i.e. the configuration will
silently break.

One solution to make the configuration more robust is to explicitly
assign the addresses in question, using extra ``<interface>`` elements.
(Note, however, that adding an ``<interface>`` element might also affect
the automatically assigned addresses, so it makes sense to add all
``<interface>`` rules together at once, instead of one-by-one.) Another
solution would be to let ``<route>`` elements refer to addresses
symbolically, i.e. be able to formally express *"the address of
router1's interface that faces router0"* instead of spelling out
"10.0.0.18". However, support for such mini-language has not yet been
added to the configurator.

Results
~~~~~~~

The routing table of ``router0`` (manually added route highlighted):

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 7

   Node ConfiguratorB.router0
   -- Routing table --
   Destination      Netmask          Gateway          Iface            Metric
   10.0.0.18        255.255.255.255  *                eth1 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.22        255.255.255.255  *                eth2 (10.0.0.21)      0
   10.0.0.25        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.22        eth2 (10.0.0.21)      0
   10.0.0.35        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.18        eth1 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.0         255.255.255.248  *                eth0 (10.0.0.4)       0
   10.0.0.32        255.255.255.248  10.0.0.22        eth2 (10.0.0.21)      0
   10.0.0.0         255.255.255.224  10.0.0.18        eth1 (10.0.0.17)      0

The routing table of ``router0`` in the previous step had six entries.
Now it has seven, as the rule specified in the XML configuration has
been added (highlighted). This and the second to last rule both match
packets to ``host7``, but the manually added route takes effect because
it has a longer netmask (plus it's also earlier in the table).

The following animation depicts ``host1`` pinging ``host7`` and
``host0`` pinging ``host6``. Routes to ``host7`` are visualized.

   :width: 100%

   <!--internal video recording run until 1s playback speed 1.5 animation speed none zoom 0.77 crop 30 70 150 80-->

Note that only routes towards ``host7`` are diverted at ``router0``. The
ping reply packet uses the original route between ``router0`` and
``router2``. Ping packets to ``host6`` (and back) also use the original
route.

Part B - Overriding routes to a set of hosts
--------------------------------------------

In this part, we will override routes going from the subnet of hosts
0--2 to the subnet of hosts 6--8. These routes will go through
``router1``, just as in Part A.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration in omnetpp.ini:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step5B
   :end-before: ####

As in Part A, the routing table of ``router0`` has to be altered, so
that packets to hosts 6--8 go towards ``router1``. The XML configuration
in step5b.xml is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../step5b.xml
   :language: xml

The ``<route>`` element specifies a routing table entry for ``router0``.
The destination is 10.0.0.32 with netmask 255.255.255.248, which
designates the addresses of hosts 6--8. The gateway is ``router1``'s
address, the interface is the one connected towards ``router1``
(``eth1``). This rule is added to ``router0``'s routing table *in
addition* to the rule added automatically by the configurator. They
match the same packets, but the parameters are different (see at the
result section below.) The manually added routes come before the
automatic ones in routing tables, their prefix length and metrics are
the same; thus, the manual ones take precedence.

Results
~~~~~~~

Here is the routing table of ``router0`` (the manually added route
highlighted):

.. code-block:: none
   :emphasize-lines: 12

   Node ConfiguratorB.router0
   -- Routing table --
   Destination      Netmask          Gateway          Iface            Metric
   10.0.0.10        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.18        eth1 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.18        255.255.255.255  *                eth1 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.22        255.255.255.255  *                eth2 (10.0.0.21)      0
   10.0.0.25        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.22        eth2 (10.0.0.21)      0
   10.0.0.26        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.18        eth1 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.33        255.255.255.255  10.0.0.22        eth2 (10.0.0.21)      0
   10.0.0.0         255.255.255.248  *                eth0 (10.0.0.4)       0
   10.0.0.8         255.255.255.248  10.0.0.18        eth1 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.32        255.255.255.248  10.0.0.18        eth1 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.32        255.255.255.248  10.0.0.22        eth2 (10.0.0.21)      0

The following is the animation of ``host1`` pinging ``host7`` and
``host0`` pinging ``host6``, similarly to Part A. Routes to ``host7``
are visualized.

.. video:: media/Step5B_1_cropped.mp4
   :width: 100%

   <!--internal video recording run until 1s playback speed 1.5 animation speed none zoom 0.77 crop 30 70 150 80-->

This time both packets destined to hosts 6 and 7 take the diverted
route and the replies come back on the original route.
