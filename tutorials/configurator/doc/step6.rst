Step 6. Setting different metric for automatic routing table configuration
==========================================================================

Goals
-----

When setting up routes, the configurator uses the shortest path
algorithm. By default, paths are optimized for hop count. However, there
are other cost functions available, like data rate, error rate, etc.
This step consists of two parts:

- **Part A** demonstrates using the data rate metric for automatically setting up routes.
- **Part B** demonstrates instructing the configurator not to use a link when setting
  up routes, by manually specifying a high link cost.

Part A: Using the data rate metric
----------------------------------

When setting up routes, the configurator first builds a graph
representing the network topology. A vertex in the graph represents a
network node along with all of its interfaces. An edge represents a
wired or wireless connection between two network interfaces. When
building the network topology, wireless nodes are considered to be
connected to all other wireless nodes in the same wireless network.

After the graph is built, the configurator assigns weights to vertices
and edges according to the configured metric. Vertices that represent
network nodes with IP forwarding turned off have infinite weight; all
others have 0. Finally, the shortest path algorithm is used to determine
the routes based on the assigned weights.

The available metrics are the following:

- ``hopCount``: routes are optimized for hop count. All edges have a cost of 1.
  This is the default metric.
- ``dataRate``: routes prefer connections with higher bandwidth. Edge costs are
  inversely proportional to the data rate of the
  connection.
- ``delay``: routes are optimized for lower delay. Edge costs are proportional
  to the delay of the connection.
- ``errorRate``: routes are optimized for smaller error rate. Edge costs are proportional
  to the error rate of the connection. This is mostly useful for wireless
  networks because the error rate of wired connections is usually negligible.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration for this step extends Step 4, thus, it uses the
:ned:`ConfiguratorA` network. The configuration in omnetpp.ini is the
following:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step6A
   :end-before: ####

Below is the XML configuration in step6a.xml:

.. literalinclude:: ../step6a.xml
   :language: xml

The XML configuration contains the default rule for IP address
assignment, and an ``<autoroute>`` element that configures the metric to
be used. The ``<autoroute>`` element specifies parameters for automatic
static routing table configuration. If no ``<autoroute>`` element is
specified, the configurator assumes a default that affects all routing
tables in the network, and computes shortest paths to all interfaces
according to the hop count metric. The ``<autoroute>`` element can
contain the following attributes: 

- ``sourceHosts``: Selector attribute that selects which hosts' routing tables should be modified. The default value is ``"**"``. 
- ``destinationInterfaces``: Parameter attribute that selects destination interfaces for which the shortest paths will be calculated. The default value is ``"**"``. 
- ``metric``: Parameter attribute that sets the metric to be used when calculating shortest paths. The default value is ``"hopCount"``.

There are sub-elements available in ``<autoroute>``, which will be
discussed in Part B.

Here the ``<autoroute>`` element specifies that routes should be added
to the routing table of each host and the metric should be ``dataRate``.
The configurator assigns weights to the graph's edges that are inversely
proportional to the data rate of the network links. This way route
generation will favor routes with higher data rates.

Note that ``router0`` and ``router2`` are connected with a 10 Mbit/s
ethernet cable, while ``router1`` connects to the other routers with 100
Mbit/s ethernet cables. Since routes are optimized for data rate,
packets from ``router0`` to ``router2`` will go via ``router1`` because
this path has higher bandwidth.

Results

The following image shows the backward routes towards ``host1``. The
resulting routes are similar to the ones in Step 5B. The difference is
that routes going backward, from hosts 6--8 to hosts 0--2, go through
``router1``. No traffic is routed between ``router0`` and ``router2`` at
all (as opposed to Step 4 and 5.)

.. figure:: media/step6aroutes.png
   :width: 100%

The routing table of ``router0`` is as follows:

.. code-block:: none

   Node ConfiguratorA.router0
   -- Routing table --
   Destination      Netmask          Gateway          Iface            Metric
   10.0.0.18        255.255.255.255  *                eth1 (10.0.0.17)      0
   10.0.0.0         255.255.255.248  *                eth0 (10.0.0.4)       0
   10.0.0.0         255.255.255.192  10.0.0.18        eth1 (10.0.0.17)      0

The first two rules describe reaching ``router1`` and hosts 0--2
directly. The last rule specifies that traffic to any other destination
should be routed towards ``router1``.

The routing table of ``router2`` is similar:

.. code-block:: none

   Node ConfiguratorA.router2
   -- Routing table --
   Destination      Netmask          Gateway          Iface            Metric
   10.0.0.26        255.255.255.255  *                eth0 (10.0.0.25)      0
   10.0.0.32        255.255.255.248  *                eth1 (10.0.0.33)      0
   10.0.0.0         255.255.255.224  10.0.0.26        eth0 (10.0.0.25)      0

The following video shows ``host1`` pinging ``host7`` and ``host0``
pinging ``host6``. Routes towards ``host1`` are visualized. The packets
don't use the link between ``router0`` and ``router2``.

.. video:: media/Step6A_1_cropped.mp4
   :width: 100%

   <!--internal video recording run until 1s playback speed 1.5 animation speed none zoom 0.77 crop 30 70 150 80-->

One can easily check that no routes go through the link between
``router0`` and ``router2`` by setting the destination filter to ``"*"``
in the visualizer. This indicates all routes in the network:

Part B - Manually specifying link cost
--------------------------------------

This part configures the same routes as Part A, where routes between
``router0`` and ``router2`` lead through ``router1``.

The configurator is instructed not to use the link between ``router0``
and ``router2`` when setting up routes, by specifying the cost of the
link to be infinite.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration for this step in omnetpp.ini is the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step6B
   :end-before: ####

The XML configuration in step6b.xml is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: ../step6b.xml
   :language: xml

The ``<autoroute>`` elements can also contain the following optional
sub-elements, which can be used to specify costs in the graph: 

- ``<node>``: Specifies cost parameters to network nodes. The ``hosts`` selector attribute selects which hosts are affected, and the ``cost`` parameter sets their costs. Both attributes are mandatory. 
- ``<link>``: Specifies cost parameters to network links. The ``interfaces`` selector attribute selects which links are affected, by specifying an interface they belong to. The ``cost`` parameter sets the cost. Both attributes are mandatory.

This XML configuration specifies the metric to be hop count and sets
the cost of ``router0``'s eth2 interface to infinite. This affects the
link between ``router0`` and ``router2`` - no routes should go through
it.

Results
~~~~~~~

The routes towards ``host1`` are visualized on the following image:

.. figure:: media/step6broutes.png
   :width: 100%

The routes are the same as in Part A, where the data rate metric was
used, and routes didn't use the 10Mbps link between ``router0`` and
``router2``. In this part, the link between ``router0`` and ``router2``
is "turned off" by specifying an infinite cost for it. The following
video shows ``host1`` pinging ``host7``. Routes towards ``host1`` are
visualized. The ping packets take the diverted route in both directions:
