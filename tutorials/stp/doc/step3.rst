Step 3. Root Bridge Election by Priority
=========================================

Goals
-----

This step shows how to control which switch becomes the root bridge by
configuring bridge priorities, instead of relying on MAC address ordering.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration extends ``Step2`` with a single extra parameter:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: [Config Step3]
   :end-before: ------

Setting ``bridgePriority = 1`` on ``switch3`` gives it a bridge ID of
``1:AAAAAA000003``, which is lower than all other switches (whose bridge IDs
are ``32768:AAAAAA0000xx``). Therefore ``switch3`` wins the root election
regardless of its MAC address.

The bridge priority can be set per-switch using the ``**.switchN.**.bridgePriority``
parameter, or configured across multiple switches using :ned:`L2NetworkConfigurator`.
The default value is 32768.

.. note::
   Per IEEE 802.1D, valid bridge priority values are multiples of 4096 from 0
   to 61440 (the priority occupies the upper 4 bits of the 2-byte Bridge ID).
   INET does not enforce this constraint, so any integer value is accepted by
   the ``bridgePriority`` parameter.

Results
~~~~~~~

With ``switch3`` as root, the spanning tree is rooted at a different location
compared to Step 2. The blocked ports change accordingly — different links are
placed in blocking state to create the new loop-free tree.

Comparing the two figures (Step 2 vs Step 3) clearly shows how the root bridge
location determines the shape of the spanning tree. Traffic from ``host2`` to
``host1`` still succeeds after convergence, but may follow a different path.
