Step 21. Displaying transport connections
=========================================

Goals
-----

In a large network with many transport layer applications, it can be
difficult to examine which nodes communicate with which. Visualizing
transport connections makes it easy to identify connections by their two
endpoints and it also gives a quick overview about the number of
connections in individual nodes. In this step, we show how to visualize
transport connections.
