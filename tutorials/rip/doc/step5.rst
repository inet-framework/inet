Step 5. RIP Triggered Update
============================

Goals
-----

TODO: triggered updates are turned on, routers should be notified of
link break sooner

The model
---------

TODO: how triggered updates work (maybe should be described in an
earlier step?)

TODO: the network and the config

Results
-------

TODO: video

Triggered updates are enabled, so other routers are notified of the
broken link right after it breaks (around 52s), not after the next
scheduled update (at 60s).
