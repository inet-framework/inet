Step 2. Pinging after RIP convergence
=====================================

Goals
-----

In this step, RIP is used for routing in the routers. TODO: the advanced
RIP features are turned off

The model
---------

TODO: about RIP and the INET implementation

TODO: the network and config for this step

Results
-------

TODO: video

Rip convergence:



   .. video:: media/step2_3.mp4



   <!--internal video recording, normal run until sendPing, animation speed none, playback speed 2.138, max anim speed kludge in simtimetextfigure-->

Ping (basically the same as in step 1, so not sure it's needed):



   .. video:: media/step2_3_ping.mp4



   <!--internal video recording, normal run from the end of the previous video until 51s, animation speed none, playback speed 2.138, max anim speed kludge in simtimetextfigure-->

TODO: what happens
