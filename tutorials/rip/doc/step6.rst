Step 6. Count to Infinity Problem (Two-node Loop Instability)
=============================================================

Introduction
-----------

In the previous steps, we've explored how RIP builds and maintains routing tables in both stable networks and during topology changes. Now, we'll examine one of the most significant challenges of distance-vector routing protocols like RIP: the count-to-infinity problem.

The count-to-infinity problem is a fundamental issue in distance-vector routing that can occur when network topology changes, particularly when links fail. It can lead to routing loops, slow convergence, and temporary network unreachability. Understanding this problem and its solutions is crucial for anyone working with RIP or similar protocols.

Goals
-----

In this step, our goals are to:

1. Understand the count-to-infinity problem and why it occurs in distance-vector routing
2. Observe how the problem manifests in a simple two-router network
3. Explore different solutions to the problem, including split horizon and poison reverse
4. Understand the limitations of these solutions

Understanding the Count-to-Infinity Problem
-----------------------------------------

The count-to-infinity problem occurs when routers continue to increment metrics for routes that are no longer valid, potentially counting up to "infinity" (which is 16 in RIP) before the routes are removed.

Here's how it typically happens:

1. Router A and Router B both have routes to Network X
2. Router A's route to Network X fails
3. Router B still has its route to Network X (possibly through Router A)
4. Router B advertises this route to Router A
5. Router A accepts this route, increments the metric, and adds it to its routing table
6. Router A then advertises this route back to Router B
7. Router B sees a higher metric but still updates its route
8. This cycle continues, with metrics incrementing until they reach "infinity"

During this process, packets may loop between routers, and the network takes a long time to converge to a stable state where the invalid routes are removed.

Network Configuration
---------------------

For this step, we use a simpler network topology defined in ``RipNetworkB.ned``. This network consists of two routers connected directly to each other, with each router also connected to a LAN switch with several hosts:

.. figure:: media/step6_network.png
   :width: 80%
   :align: center

This simplified topology allows us to clearly observe the count-to-infinity problem between just two routers.

The configuration in ``omnetpp.ini`` is the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step6
   :end-before: ------

Key aspects of this configuration:
* Split horizon is disabled (``mode='NoSplitHorizon'``)
* Triggered updates are disabled
* A scenario manager script disconnects the link between ``router1`` and ``switch1`` at t=50s

Experiment 1: Demonstrating the Count-to-Infinity Problem
-------------------------------------------------------

In our first experiment (``[Config Step6]``), we demonstrate the basic count-to-infinity problem. When the link between ``router1`` and ``switch1`` breaks at t=50s, the following sequence of events occurs:

1. ``router1`` loses direct connectivity to hosts 3, 4, and 5
2. ``router0`` still has a route to these hosts (through ``router1``)
3. ``router0`` advertises this route to ``router1``
4. ``router1`` accepts this route, increments the hop count, and adds it to its routing table
5. ``router1`` then advertises this route back to ``router0``
6. This cycle continues, with hop counts incrementing with each exchange

The result is that convergence takes approximately 220 seconds (from the link break at t=50s to the removal of invalid routes at t=270s). During this time, the hop count for routes to hosts 3, 4, and 5 gradually increases until it reaches 16, at which point the routes are considered unreachable.

   :width: 80%
   :align: center

You can also observe how ping packets from ``host0`` to ``host3`` bounce back and forth between the two routers, indicating the presence of a routing loop. The ping packets eventually time out after 8 hops and are dropped.

Experiment 2: Count-to-Infinity as a Race Condition
-------------------------------------------------

Interestingly, the count-to-infinity problem doesn't always occur, even with the same network topology. In ``[Config Step6DifferentTimings]``, we demonstrate that the problem can be avoided depending on the timing of router updates:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step6DifferentTimings
   :end-before: ------

In this configuration, we set different startup times for the routers:
* ``router1`` starts RIP at t=0.5s
* ``router0`` starts RIP at t=1s

With this timing, ``router1`` sends its update first after the link failure, informing ``router0`` that the routes are no longer available before ``router0`` has a chance to advertise its outdated routes back to ``router1``. This prevents the count-to-infinity problem from occurring.

.. video:: media/step6_1.mp4
   :width: 100%

..   <!--internal video recording, zoom 0.77, playback speed 1, no animation speed-->

This demonstrates that the count-to-infinity problem is essentially a race condition - it depends on which router sends its updates first after a topology change.

Experiment 3: Triggered Updates Don't Solve the Problem
----------------------------------------------------

One might think that triggered updates would help solve the count-to-infinity problem by speeding up convergence. However, in ``[Config Step6TriggeredUpdates]``, we demonstrate that triggered updates alone don't solve the problem:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step6TriggeredUpdates
   :end-before: ------

With triggered updates enabled, the routers send updates immediately when their routing tables change. However, this can actually make the count-to-infinity problem worse by accelerating the rate at which incorrect routing information propagates. The network still experiences routing loops and slow convergence.

Solution 1: Split Horizon
-----------------------

One effective solution to the count-to-infinity problem is split horizon. In ``[Config Step6Solution1]``, we demonstrate how split horizon prevents the problem:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step6Solution1
   :end-before: ------

Split horizon is a simple rule: a router will not advertise routes back to the neighbor from which it learned them. This prevents the feedback loop that causes the count-to-infinity problem.

With split horizon enabled:
1. When ``router1`` loses its direct connection to hosts 3, 4, and 5
2. ``router0`` still has routes to these hosts (through ``router1``)
3. However, due to split horizon, ``router0`` will not advertise these routes back to ``router1``
4. This breaks the feedback loop and prevents the count-to-infinity problem

Split horizon is particularly effective in simple topologies like our two-router network, where it completely prevents the count-to-infinity problem.

Solution 2: Split Horizon with Poison Reverse
------------------------------------------

An even stronger solution is split horizon with poison reverse, demonstrated in ``[Config Step6Solution2]``:

.. literalinclude:: ../omnetpp.ini
   :language: ini
   :start-at: Step6Solution2
   :end-before: ------

With poison reverse, a router not only follows the split horizon rule but also actively advertises routes learned from a neighbor back to that neighbor with a metric of 16 (infinity). This explicitly tells the neighbor not to use these routes.

For example:
1. ``router0`` learns routes to hosts 3, 4, and 5 from ``router1``
2. With poison reverse, ``router0`` advertises these routes back to ``router1`` with a metric of 16
3. This ensures that ``router1`` will never use ``router0`` as a path to these hosts

Poison reverse provides an extra layer of protection against routing loops, though it does increase the size of routing updates.

Limitations of These Solutions
----------------------------

While split horizon and poison reverse are effective in simple topologies like our two-router network, they have limitations:

1. They don't completely solve the count-to-infinity problem in networks with more than two routers (which we'll explore in Step 7)
2. They increase the size of routing updates, especially poison reverse
3. They can slow down convergence in certain scenarios

Despite these limitations, split horizon and poison reverse are widely used in RIP implementations as they significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of the count-to-infinity problem.

Conclusion and Next Steps
------------------------

In this step, we've explored the count-to-infinity problem in a simple two-router network and examined several solutions, including split horizon and poison reverse. We've seen how these techniques can prevent routing loops and improve convergence time after topology changes.

However, these solutions have limitations, particularly in more complex network topologies. In the next step, we'll explore the count-to-infinity problem in a network with more than two routers, where split horizon and poison reverse are not completely effective.
