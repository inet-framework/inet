protocol element tutorial (not necessarily in this order):

- delay channel
  source -> delay channel -> sink

- transmission channel using transmitter/receiver
  source -> transmitter -> transmission channel -> receiver -> sink

- transmission channel inter packet gap
  source -> inter packet gap -> transmitter -> transmission channel -> receiver -> sink

- lossy channel and checksum inserter/checker
  source -> checksum inserter -> lossy transmission channel -> checksum checker -> sink

- acknowledgement mechanism
  source -> send with acknowledge -> receive with acknowledge -> sink

- MAC address filtering
  source -> send with MAC address -> cloner -> (receive with MAC address -> sink) * 2

- sequence numbering and reordering
  source -> sequence numbering -> classifier -> (delay channel) * 2 -> join -> reordering -> sink

- resending
  source -> resending -> send with acknowledge -> lossy transmission channel -> receive with acknowledge -> sink

- duplicate removal
  source -> resending -> send with acknowledge -> lossy transmission channel -> duplicate removal -> receive with acknowledge -> sink

- send to and receive at port
  source -> send to port -> cloner -> (receive at port -> sink) * 2

- send to and receive at network address
  source -> send with network address -> cloner -> (receive with network address -> sink) * 2

- hop limit
  source -> send with hop limit -> cloner -> (receive with hop limit ++ -> sink) * 2

- fragmentation and defragmentation
  source -> fragmentation -> defragmentation -> sink

- aggregation and deaggregation
  source -> aggregation -> deaggregation -> sink
