Protocol Tutorial
=================

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a network protocol from basic building
blocks. It starts with a simple client-server communication model and
progressively adds protocol elements to create a more complete and realistic
protocol stack.

Each step introduces new protocol elements and functionality, building upon the
previous steps. By the end of the tutorial, you will understand how various
protocol elements work together to provide reliable, ordered packet delivery
over an unreliable channel.
