Step 13. Configuring a more accurate path loss model
====================================================

Goals
-----

By default, the medium uses the free-space path loss model, which
assumes a line-of-sight path, with no obstacles nearby to cause reflection
or diffraction. Since our wireless hosts move on the ground, a more
accurate path loss model would be the two-ray ground reflection model
that calculates with one reflection from the ground.

The model
---------

It has been mentioned that :ned:`ScalarRadioMedium` relies on various
subcomponents for computing path loss, obstacle loss, and background
noise, among others. Installing the two-ray ground reflection model is
just a matter of changing its ``pathLossType`` parameter from the
default :ned:`FreeSpacePathLoss` to :ned:`TwoRayGroundReflection`. (Further
options include :ned:`RayleighFading`, :ned:`RicianFading`,
:ned:`LogNormalShadowing`, and some others.)

The two-ray ground reflection model uses the altitudes of the
transmitter and the receiver antennas above the ground as input. To
compute the altitude, we need the hosts' (x,y,z) positions and the
ground's elevation at those points. The z coordinates of hosts have been
set to 1.7m in an earlier step. The ground's elevation is defined by the
ground model, which is part of the physical environment model.

In this model, we'll use :ned:`FlatGround` for the ground model, and specify it
to the ``physicalEnvironment`` module. (Note that we added
``physicalEnvironment`` to the network when we introduced obstacles.)
The ground's elevation is the ``elevation`` parameter of :ned:`FlatGround`.
We set this parameter to 0m.

Results
-------

The image below shows the bit error rate of host R1's radio as a
function of time. The bit error rate is shown when free space path loss
is used, and when using the two-ray ground reflection model. The
interval shown here corresponds to the time in the simulation when host
R1 is not cut off from host A by the wall anymore, and also still in
communication range of host A and B. In the interval that is shown, from
around 5 seconds to 11 seconds, the distance between host R1 and hosts A
and B is increasing, which results in an increase in the bit error rate
as well. There is no significant difference between the free space
propagation path loss and the two-ray ground reflection path loss at
first. The two curves separate towards the end of the displayed
interval. As expected, in the case of the two-ray ground reflection
model, the bit error rate is greater.
