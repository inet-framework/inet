Step 6. Using CSMA to better utilize the medium
===============================================

Goals
-----

In this step, we try to increase the utilization of the communication
channel by choosing a medium access control (MAC) protocol that is
better suited for wireless communication.

In the previous step, nodes transmitted on the channel immediately when
they had something to send, without first listening for ongoing
transmissions. This resulted in a lot of collisions and lost packets. We
improve the communication by using the CSMA protocol, which is based on
the "sense before transmit" (or "listen before talk") principle.

CSMA (carrier sense multiple access) is a probabilistic MAC protocol 
in which a node verifies the absence of other traffic before transmitting
on the shared transmission medium. CSMA has several variants; we'll use
CSMA/CA (where CA stands for collision avoidance). In this protocol, a
node that has data to send first waits for the channel to become idle,
and then it also waits for a random backoff period. If the channel is
still idle during the backoff, the node can actually start transmitting.
Otherwise, the procedure starts over, possibly with an updated range for
the backoff period. We expect that the use of CSMA will improve
throughput, as there will be fewer collisions, and the medium will be
utilized better.

The model
---------

To use CSMA, we need to replace ``AckingWirelessInterface`` in the hosts with
``WirelessInterface``. ``WirelessInterface`` is a generic NIC with both the radio
and the MAC module left open, so we specify :ned:`GenericUnitDiskRadio` for its
``radioType`` parameter, and :ned:`CsmaCaMac` for ``macType``.

The :ned:`CsmaCaMac` module implements CSMA/CA with optional
acknowledgments and a retry mechanism. It has a number of parameters
for tweaking its operation. With the appropriate parameters, it can
approximate basic 802.11b ad-hoc mode operation. Parameters include:

- acknowledgments on/off
- bit rate (this is used for both data and ACK frames)
- protocol overhead: MAC header length, ACK frame length
- backoff parameters: minimum/maximum contention window (in slots),
  slot time, maximum retry count
- timing: interval to wait before transmitting ACK frame (SIFS) and
  before data frames in addition to the backoff slots (DIFS)

For now, we do not use an acknowledgment (sending of ACK packets), so we
can see purely the effect of "listen before talk" and waiting a random
backoff period before each transmission (this is the default behavior
for the MAC). In the absence of ACKs, the MAC has to assume that all its
transmissions are successful, so no frame is ever retransmitted.

Results
-------

The effect of CSMA can be seen in the animation below. The first two
packets are sent by host A, and after waiting for a backoff period, host
R1 retransmits both packets. This time, host B receives them correctly,
because only host R1 is transmitting.

The following sequence chart displays that after receiving the UDPData-2
packet, host R1 transmits it after the backoff period timer has expired.

It is already apparent by watching the simulation that there are much
fewer collisions this time. The numbers also confirm that CSMA has
worked: nearly eight times as many packets are received by host B than
in the previous step.

**Number of packets received by host B: 1374**
