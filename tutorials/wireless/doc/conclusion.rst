Conclusion
==========

Congratulations, you've made it! You should now be familiar with the
basic concepts of modeling wireless networks with the INET Framework.

We are planning further tutorials to touch on topics that have not made
it into the present one. These topics include using multi-dimensional
signal modeling; bit-precise signal modeling; forward error correction,
scrambling, interleaving; and run-time optimization by using MAC address
and range filtering.

A separate tutorial will be devoted to 802.11 simulations.
