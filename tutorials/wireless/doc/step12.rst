Step 12. Changing to a more realistic radio model
=================================================

Goals
-----

After so many steps, we let go of the unit disk radio model and introduce a
more realistic one. Our new radio will use an APSK modulation scheme,
but still without other techniques like forward error correction,
interleaving or spreading. We also want our model of the radio channel
to simulate attenuation and obstacle loss.

The model
---------

Switching to APSK radio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this step, we replace :ned:`GenericUnitDiskRadio` with :ned:`ApskScalarRadio`.
:ned:`ApskScalarRadio` models a radio with an APSK (amplitude and
phase-shift keying) modulation scheme. By default it uses BPSK, but
QPSK, QAM-16, QAM-64, QAM-256 and several other modulations can also be
configured. (Modulation is a parameter of the radio's transmitter
component.)

Since we are moving away from the "unit disc radio" type of abstraction,
we need to specify the carrier frequency, signal bandwidth and
transmission power of the radios. Together with other parameters, they
will allow the radio channel and the receiver models to compute path
loss, SNIR, bit error rate, and other values, and ultimately determine
the success of the reception.

:ned:`ApskScalarRadio` also adds realism in that it simulates that the data
are preceded by a preamble and a physical layer header. Their lengths
are also parameters (and may be set to zero when not needed.)

NOTE: When choosing the preamble and the physical layer header lengths,
we needed to take care that the ``ackTimeout`` parameter of
:ned:`CsmaCaMac` is still valid. (The preamble and the physical layer
header contribute to the duration of the ACK frame as well.)

Physical parameters of the receiver are important, too. We configure the
following receiver parameters: - sensitivity [dBm]: if the signal power
is below this threshold, reception is not possible (i.e. the receiver
cannot go from the *channel busy* state to *receiving*) - energy
detection threshold [dBm]: if reception power is below this threshold,
no signal is detected and the channel is sensed to be empty (this is
significant for the "carrier sense" part of CSMA) - SNIR threshold [dB]:
reception is not successful if the SNIR is below this threshold

The concrete values in the inifile were chosen to approximately
reproduce the communication and interference ranges used in the previous
steps.

Setting up the wireless channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since we switched the radio to :ned:`ApskScalarRadio`, we also need to
change the medium to :ned:`ScalarRadioMedium`. In general, one always
needs to use a medium that is compatible with the given radio. (With
:ned:`GenericUnitDiskRadio`, we also used :ned:`UnitDiskRadioMedium`.)

:ned:`ScalarRadioMedium` has "slots" to plug in various propagation
models, path loss models, obstacle loss models, analog models, and
background noise models. Here we make use of the fact that the default
background noise model is homogeneous isotropic white noise, and set up
the noise level to a nonzero value (-90dBm).

Configuration:

   :language: ini
   :start-at: [Config Wireless12]
   :end-before: #---

Results
-------

What happens is about the same as in the previous step. At first, host
A's packets are relayed by host R2 until it moves so that the wall
separates them. The connection is re-established when host R1 moves out
from behind the wall. Then it gets out of communication range, and the
new route goes through hosts R2 and R3.

In this model, more physical effects are simulated than in previous
steps. There are radio signal attenuation, background noise and a more
realistic radio model. The blue circles representing the communication range
is an approximation. There is no distinct distance where receptions
fail, as in the case of :ned:`GenericUnitDiskRadio`.

In host A, the MAC receives the packet UDPData-408 from the radio. The
MAC drops the packet because of bit errors; this can be seen in the
following log:
