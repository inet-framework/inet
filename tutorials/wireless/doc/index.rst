Wireless Tutorial
=================

In this tutorial, we show you how to build wireless simulations in the
INET Framework. The tutorial contains a series of simulation models
numbered from 1 through 14. The models are of increasing complexity --
they start from the basics, and in each step, they introduce new INET
features and concepts related to wireless communication networks.

In the tutorial, each step is a separate configuration in the same
omnetpp.ini file. Steps build on each other; they extend the
configuration of the previous step by adding a few new lines.
Consecutive steps mostly share the same network, defined in NED.

This is an advanced tutorial, and it assumes that you are familiar with
creating and running simulations in OMNeT++ and INET. If you aren't, you
can check out the TicToc Tutorial to get started with using OMNeT++.
