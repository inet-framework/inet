Generic Classifier
==================

The :ned:`PacketClassifier` module classifies packets
based on the configured packet classifier function.

In this example network, packets are generated by an active packet source (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`).
The packets are pushed into a :ned:`PacketClassifier` module, which are connected to two passive
packet sinks (:ned:`PassivePacketSink`).

The source generates 1-byte packets, which randomly contain either 0 or 1 as data. The classifier
is configured to use the ``PacketDataClassifier`` function to classify packets. The function selects the
classifier's output where the output index matches the data contained in the packet.
Thus packets with data 0 are pushed to ``consumer1``, and those with data 1 to ``consumer2``.
