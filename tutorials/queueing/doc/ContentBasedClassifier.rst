Content-Based Classifier
========================

The :ned:`ContentBasedClassifier` module classifies packets according to the configured packet
filter and packet data filter expressions.

In this example network, packets are generated by an active packet source (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`).
The packets are pushed into a :ned:`ContentBasedClassifier`, which is connected to two passive
packet sinks (:ned:`PassivePacketSink`).
The packet source generates 1-byte packets with either 0 or 1 as data randomly. The classifier's
packet data filter is configured to send packets which contain 0 to output 0, and those
that contain 1 to output 1.
