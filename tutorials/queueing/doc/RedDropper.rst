RED Dropper
===========

This step demonstrates the :ned:`RedDropper` module, which implements the Random Early Detection
algorithm.

Packets are created by an active packet source (:ned:`ActivePacketSource`), which
pushes packets to the dropper module. The dropper module drops packets with a probability depending
on the number of packets contained in the queue (:ned:`PacketQueue`) connected to its output.
The packets are collected by an active packet sink (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`).
