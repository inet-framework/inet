Markov-Chain-Based Scheduler
============================

The :ned:`MarkovScheduler` module uses a Markov process to schedule packets.
The current state of the Markov process selects the input gate; a configurable
transition matrix determines the probabilities of state change; the configured
wait intervals determine the time between state changes. If the provider at the
selected input cannot prodivide a packet for duration of the state's wait interval,
the process switches to the next state without pulling a packet.

In this example network, packets are generated by two passive packet sources (:ned:`PassivePacketSource`).
The packet sources are connected to a scheduler (:ned:`MarkovScheduler`).
Packets are popped from the scheduler by an active packet sink (:ned:`ActivePacketSink`).
The scheduler in turn pops packets from one of the packet sources, based on the current
state of the Markov process.
