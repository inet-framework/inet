IEEE 802.1d examples
====================

These examples show the STP/RSTP capability of the Ethernet switch.

STP and RSTP are network protocols that ensure a loop-free topology for any 
bridged Ethernet local area network. The basic function of STP/RSTP is 
to prevent bridge loops and the broadcast radiation that results from them.
The protocols achieve this goal by disabling certain links to turn the 
topology in to a tree. The time needed by STP to make the topology 
loop-free is nearly 50s, while RSTP only needs 6s.

The example network contains a network with several loops in it.
After the STP/RSTP has done its job, the spanning tree and the root switch
highlighted with light blue.

Switch1RootByMAC
----------------
The example shows without any configuration how Switch1 chosen to be the root, because it has the lowest MAC address.
Also you can check how the shortest path will be chosen. Switch2 will route his traffic through Switch4 instead of Switch7,
because it has shorter path to the root.

Switch3RootByPriority
---------------------
Now Switch3 will be the root because it has the lowest priority number.


Switch7to4BySrcPriority
-----------------------
Switch7 will route his traffic through Switch4 instead of Switch3. They have the same long path, but Switch4 has better priority.


LargeNet
--------
This example shows, how traffic runs through the network.
Also Switch4 disappears at 60s and reappears at 120s, so you can check how the tree will rebuild itself.
