This example measures the IEEE 802.11 wireless network throughput from a
number of hosts to a server through an access point (AP).

The theoretical maximum throughput can be calculated analytically. The host
and the access point transmitter powers are configured so that every host
hears all the others.

1. 6 clients and 1 server throughput, over the AP

Calculating the theoretical throughput maximum becomes quite complicated
due to collisions and different interframe durations. Approximate
calculation results in 6 Mbps theoretical maximum while measurements show
5.36 Mbps. Add the throughput at the sink of the server to the throughput
at the AP to get this value.

The difference can be roughly calculated based on the number of frame
collisions which results in 400 kbps. The remaining difference is probably
caused by the simulation waiting EIFS after collision, while the spreadsheet
simply calculates with DIFS.
