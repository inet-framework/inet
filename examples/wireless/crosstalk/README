This example demonstrates how to simulate crosstalk between IEEE 802.11 networks.

NOTE: The current error model computes the bit error rate from the minimum SNIR.
The minimum SNIR is computed over time and frequency which is clearly wrong in
this case, because the spectrum may have a long tail which results in a low
minimum SNIR especially if the two signals only slightly overlap>

TODO: change the carrier frequency instead of the channel number of the signal
to have a more fine grained parameter study

TODO: change the error model to fix the above issue
