description = "An Ethernet 10BASE-T1S multidrop link with worst case pending packet delay for one node"
# the multidrop link contains 4 nodes and 1 controller
# all nodes send traffic to the controller
# node[0] misses its first transmit opportunity because the packet arrives late with 1ps
# node[1..3] have packet to send right at the start of their respective transmit opportunities
# node[1..3] start transmitting immediately with zero pending packet delay
# node[0] has to wait for all other nodes to complete their transmissions
# node[0] has to wait for the beacon from the controller
# node[0] has to wait during the transmit opportunity of the controller
# node[0] can start transmitting in its transmit opportunity of the next cycle
# expected result:
#  - the maximum packet pending delay is measured to be 231.654999us
#    1 WAIT_TO + 3 DATA + 3 COMMIT + 1 BEACON + 1 WAIT_TO + 1 IFG
#    (32b + 3 * 73B * 8 + 3 * 128b + 20b + 32b + 96b) / 10E+6bps = 231.6us
