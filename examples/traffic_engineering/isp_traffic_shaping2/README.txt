The 'isp_traffic_shaping2' is a set of simulation models and scenarios for the
investigation of the effect of ISP traffic shaping on user-perceived
performances in next-generation access networks based on OMNeT++ and INET, which
implements token-bucket filter (TBF) and VLAN-based abstract models of access
switches and nodes.
