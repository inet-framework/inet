scripts
=======

This directory includes scripts to submit array & batch jobs to a
cluster (managed by Sun Grid Engine) and do pre- & post-processing of
simulation results for a comparison study of next-generation optical
access network (NGOA) architectures.


1. Simulation run (batch processing)

arrayrun.sh:
Submit a batch job to cluster (Grid Engine) as in the following
example:
  
qsub -t 1:50 -o directoryForStandardOutput -j yes arrayrun.sh iniFile configuration


2. Data analysis (pre- and post-processing)

generateMeansPlotsForAll.pl:
Plot group means with 95% confidence intervals for batch of
simulations

generateMsgPlotsForAll.pl:
Plot the number of messages present in the system for batch of
simulations (to check the warm-up period)
