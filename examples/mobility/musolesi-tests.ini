# This tests are imagined to verify the correctness of the mobility model. In the original article, the
# real mobility traces show power law behavior, compared to exponential 
# of RWP. Here we have two scenarios that output the inter-contact time
# and contact time CCPD function for a Musolesi Mobility and a 
# pseudo RWP. Run both tests and redirect the output like:
# ./run -u Cmdenv -c TestPowerLaw > STIID;
# ./run -u Cmdenv -c TestSimilRWP > RWP;
#
# then run the parse script (gnuplot needed)
#
# . parse_comparison.sh STIID RWP; evince results/STIID-RWP-*

# You will see that RWP has a steep decrease, corresponding to an exponential decay
# (graph are linear/log) while the other has a lighter, simil power-law
# behavior. Compare these graphs with the ones in Musolesi paper. Note that
# the shuffle interval determines the point at which Musolesi model
# has the final decrease in both the graphs. The more the nodes leave their
# cluster (with growing expmean) the more the mobility behaves like a 
# RWP mobility model.
