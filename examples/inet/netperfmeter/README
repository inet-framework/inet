This NetPerfMeter example contains a small test network with a bottleneck link
of 10 Mbit/s that is shared by the SCTP connections of five endpoints. The goal
is to show that the bandwidth is equally shared among the four flows. As
example, the test scenario can be run and the scalars containing the bandwidths
of the endpoints can be printed:

./run -u Cmdenv -f omnetpp.ini && \
grep "Total Reception Bit R" scalars.sca | grep testNetwork.serverMain

(This is performed by the run-test-and-display-results script.)


The resulting output should look like this:
...
scalar testNetwork.serverMain[0].netPerfMeterApp[0]     "Total Reception Bit Rate"      1919544
scalar testNetwork.serverMain[1].netPerfMeterApp[0]     "Total Reception Bit Rate"      1951294.4
scalar testNetwork.serverMain[2].netPerfMeterApp[0]     "Total Reception Bit Rate"      1943356.8
scalar testNetwork.serverMain[3].netPerfMeterApp[0]     "Total Reception Bit Rate"      1840748.8
scalar testNetwork.serverMain[4].netPerfMeterApp[0]     "Total Reception Bit Rate"      1961361.6
