This is an example of an ECN Capable Network (ECT).
Router2 gets congested, instead of its RED queue dropping the packets, it marks
them ac CE (Congestion Experienced) in the IPv4 header, and forwards them.
Then, the receiver Echoes the CE indication to the sender in the ACK packet.
The sender reacts to the ECN-Echo by reducing its cwnd and ssthresh.
