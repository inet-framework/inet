This example demonstrates how to setup a network tunnel using a TUN interface.

The network contains a client node (running an application) that sends packets
to a server node (running another application). Packets go through a tunnel that
starts at a node called inlet and ends at another node called outlet. The tunnel
is created between these nodes by two additional TunnelApp applications using
UDP sockets.

The routing tables of the tunnel end nodes (inlet and outlet) are configured to
forward incoming packets (towards the final client and server) to the TUN
interface. When the TunnelApp receives a packet from the TUN interface, it
encapsulates the packet into another UDP packet, and forwards it to the other
end of the tunnel. When the TunnelApp at the other end receives the packet, it
decapsulates the received packet, and sends the content to the TUN interface for
further routing.

The example works with both UDP and TCP applications.
