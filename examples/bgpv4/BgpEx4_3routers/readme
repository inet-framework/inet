created by Adrian Novak (FIT VUT Brno) - BGPv4 with multi address-family support
BgpEx4_3routers simulation example
new configuration file was created
OSPF dependency was removed, this functionality was replaced by static routes
BGP works with IPv4 and IPv6 in one simulation

Topology
4 routers - R1, R2, R3, R5
R1 - AS100 - external peering with R2
R2 - AS200 - external peering with R1, internal peering with R3, R5
R3 - AS200 - external peering with R4, internal peering with R2, R5
R5 - AS200 - external peering with R6, internal peering with R2, R3 

Example supports 3 scenarios
1 - normal
2 - link drops at t = 50s between R1 and R2
3 - link drops at t = 50s and recovers at t = 225s
