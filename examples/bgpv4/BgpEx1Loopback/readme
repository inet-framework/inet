created by Adrian Novak (FIT VUT Brno) - BGPv4 with multi address-family support
BgpEx1Loopback simulation example
new configuration file was created
OSPF dependency was removed, this functionality was replaced by static routes
BGP works with IPv4 and IPv6 in one simulation

Topology
4 routers - R1, R2, R3, R4
R1 - AS100 - external peering with R2
R2 - AS200 - external peering with R1, internal peering with R3
R3 - AS200 - external peering with R4, internal peering with R2
R4 - AS300 - external peering with R3 

Example supports 3 scenarios
1 - normal
2 - link drops at t = 50s between R1 and R2
3 - link drops at t = 50s and recovers at t = 215s
