OSPF dependency was removed, this functionality was replaced by static routes
BGP works with IPv4 and IPv6 in one simulation

R1 - AS100 - external peering with R2
R2 - AS200 - external peering with R1, internal peering with R3
R3 - AS200 - external peering with R4, internal peering with R2
R4 - AS300 - external peering with R3
