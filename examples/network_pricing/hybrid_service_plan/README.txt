The 'isp_traffic_control2' is a set of simulation models and scenarios for the
investigation of schemes for excess bandwidth allocation in ISP traffic control
in shared access networks based on OMNeT++ and INET, which implements
token-bucket filter (TBF) and VLAN-based abstract models of access switches and
nodes for the evaluation of the performances of proposed schemes.
