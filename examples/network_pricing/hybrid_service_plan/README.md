The 'hybrid\_service\_plan' is a set of simulation models and scenarios for the
investigation of ISP traffic control schemes enablig and network service plans
for exploiting excess bandwidth allocation in in shared access networks based on
OMNeT++ and INET, which implements token-bucket filter (TBF) and VLAN-based
abstract models of access switches and nodes for the evaluation of the
performances of proposed schemes.
