The 'comparison_framework' is a set of simulation models and scenarios for a
comparative analysis of next-generation optical access (NGOA) architectures
based on a new research framework using OMNeT++ and INET-HNRL, which provide a
complete end-to-end communication environment for model architectures including
a TCP/IP protocol stack, application protocols, and user behavioral models for
traffic generation.
