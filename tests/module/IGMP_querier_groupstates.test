This scenario checks the following trajectories:

NO MEMBERS PRESENT --> report received --> MEMBERS PRESENT --> report received -> MEMBERS PRESENT -->
  --> leave received -> CHECKING MEMBERSHIP --> report received -> MEMBERS PRESENT -->
  --> leave received -> CHECKING MEMBERSHIP --> rexmit timer expired --> CHECKING MEMBERSHIP -->
  --> timer expired --> NO MEMBERS PRESENT 

NO MEMBERS PRESENT --> report received --> MEMBERS PRESENT --> report received --> MEMBERS PRESENT -->
  --> timer expired --> NO MEMBERS PRESENT
