This scenario checks the following trajectories:

NO MEMBERS PRESENT --> report received --> MEMBERS PRESENT --> report received -> MEMBERS PRESENT -->
  --> g-s query received -> CHECKING MEMBERSHIP --> report received -> MEMBERS PRESENT -->
  --> g-s query received -> CHECKING MEMBERSHIP --> g-s query received --> CHECKING MEMBERSHIP -->
  --> timer expired --> NO MEMBERS PRESENT 

NO MEMBERS PRESENT --> report received --> MEMBERS PRESENT --> report received --> MEMBERS PRESENT -->
  --> timer expired --> NO MEMBERS PRESENT
