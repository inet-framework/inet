This scenario checks the following trajectories:

NON MEMBER --> join group --> DELAYING MEMBER --> timer expired --> IDLE MEMBER --> leave group --> NON MEMBER

NON MEMBER --> join group --> DELAYING MEMBER --> leave group --> NON MEMBER

NON MEMBER --> join group --> DELAYING MEMBER --> timer expired --> IDLE MEMBER --> query received --> DELAYING MEMBER -->
  --> report received --> IDLE MEMBER -> query received --> DELAYING MEMBER --> query received --> DELAYING MEMBER
