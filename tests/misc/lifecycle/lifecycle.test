%description:

This test shows how the LifecycleController should be used to manage the
turned on/off state of network nodes. The nodes in the test network contain
three submodules: a test protocol, a test radio and a test mobility. The Nodes
can be turned on/off using the startup or the shutdown.
Other operations could be implemented similarly for nodes, interfaces or links.

The startup and shutting process of the individual submodules takes time and
some operation phases may depend on some other. This is implemented by splitting
up the operations into more zero simulation time duration stages. Each submodule
provides its own code that runs concurrently in the predefined stages of the
given operation. The time it takes to run a specific stage for a specific submodule
may be different. The LifecycleContoller will figure out the total time to properly
run each stage one after the other.
