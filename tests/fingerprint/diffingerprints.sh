# This script compares the fingerprint evolution of two simulation runs.
# It takes two eventlog files and outputs a diff file that can be used to
# find the first event where the fingerprints don't match.
#
# Configure the simulation by adding the following lines to the ini file:
#
# record-eventlog = true
# cmdenv-log-format = "%f %g [%l] "
# fingerprint = 0000-0000
