INET Git Hooks
==============

What are Git Hooks?
===================

Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as: commit, push, and receive.
Git hooks are a built-in feature - no need to download anything. Git hooks are run locally.

Hooks in the INET repo
======================

pre-commit:
-----------

Pre-commit hooks run before committing. This kind of hooks can force coding conventions out by
aborting the commit or make automatic corrections in staged source files.

Our script checks staged files with only few extensions defined in the allowedExtensions list
and does the following:

	- trims trailing whitespaces,
	- replaces tabs with four spaces.

Note that, these changes are silently made before committing and are made not only on the diffs
but on the whole file.

How to use our hooks?
=====================

Git hooks are in the repository's .git/hooks folder. We distribute our custom scripts in
_scripts/hooks so if you would like to add our hooks to your own repository you can run
_scripts/init_gitrepo which creates a symlink or just simply copy our scripts to the
.git/hooks folder.
