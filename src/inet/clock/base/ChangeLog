2021-12-11  Gyorgy Szaszko

	Added display directive for time difference to a reference clock.

2021-12-10  Gyorgy Szaszko

	Added display string directive to display time in natural unit.

2021-06-25  Levente Mészáros

	Added minimal NED documentation to base modules.

2021-06-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	Made compatible with cancelEvent() and cancelAndDelete() functions.

2021-04-09  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed the bug that the clock wasn't returning the *exact* clock time of clock
	events when they actually executed.
	DriftingOscillatorBase: Replaced relativeSpeed with inverseDriftRate to
	avoid double arithmetic precision loss for large simulation times.

2021-03-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	Changed if-else-if ladders in initialize() to separate if statements because
	different stages may have the same number.

2021-02-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added emits for recording time.

2021-01-28  Levente Mészáros

	Extracted the ClockEvent class to be a C++ class instead of it being generated.
	The reason is that it seems to have more and more custom code.

2021-01-22  Levente Mészáros

	Extracted DriftingOscillatorBase module.

2021-01-11  ------ inet-4.3.0 released ------

2020-07-31  Levente Mészáros and Zoltán Böjthe

	Added new clock base package with modules: ClockBase and OscillatorBase.
