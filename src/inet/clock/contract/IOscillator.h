/**
 * TODO: oscillator computation origin may not have a tick
 *
 * @brief Interface for oscillators.
 *
 * An oscillator produces periodic "ticks". It defines a nominal tick interval that
 * serves as a reference duration between ticks, although the actual intervals may vary.
 * Ticks are measured relative to a defined computation origin, which is the simulation
 * time at which the oscillator starts counting ticks. Although a tick can be scheduled
 * at the computation origin, the mapping functions below count only ticks that occur
 * after the computation origin.
 *
 * To improve simulation performance, the oscillator does not generate individual events
 * for every tick. Instead, it provides two mapping functions:
 * - One that computes the number of ticks that occur within a given time interval measured from the origin.
 * - One that computes the minimal time interval required to include a specified number of ticks measured from the origin.
 *
 * When the underlying state affecting tick timing changes, the oscillator emits signals
 * to notify interested listeners:
 * - preOscillatorStateChangedSignal is emitted immediately before the change.
 * - postOscillatorStateChangedSignal is emitted immediately after the change.
 *
 * @note For detailed configuration, see the corresponding NED file.
