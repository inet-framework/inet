/**
 * @brief Interface for oscillators.
 *
 * An oscillator produces conceptual “tick” instants. It exposes a nominal tick
 * interval as a reference, but the actual tick timing may deviate (e.g., due to
 * drift or phase). For performance, the oscillator does not generate an event
 * per tick; instead it provides two mapping functions that translate between a
 * time interval and the number of ticks within that interval, both measured
 * from a computation origin.
 *
 * Computation origin:
 * - The computation origin `o` is a simulation time (o <= now) from which tick
 *   counting is defined. The origin need not coincide with a tick; i.e., the
 *   first tick after the origin may occur strictly later.
 *
 * Mathematical semantics:
 * - Let {τ_i | i = 1,2,...} be the strictly increasing sequence of tick times
 *   after the origin (relative to `o`), so each absolute tick time is o + τ_i.
 * - Define the step function (tick count from origin):
 *     N(Δt) := |{ i : 0 < τ_i <= Δt }|, for Δt >= 0.
 *   (Ticks at the origin are not counted; a tick exactly at Δt is counted.)
 * - Define the generalized inverse (minimal interval for n ticks):
 *     I(n) := inf { Δt >= 0 : N(Δt) >= n }, for n >= 0.
 *   (By convention I(0) = 0.)
 *
 * Properties:
 * - N is non-decreasing and right-continuous, with unit jumps at tick instants.
 * - I is the right-inverse of N: N(I(n)) >= n and I(N(Δt)) <= Δt.
 * - Monotonicity:
 *     Δt1 <= Δt2  ⇒ N(Δt1) <= N(Δt2),
 *     n1  <= n2   ⇒ I(n1)  <= I(n2).
 * - Nominal tick length returned by getNominalTickLength() is a fixed reference
 *   parameter; it does not imply actual tick spacing is constant.
 *
 * Signals:
 * - preOscillatorStateChangedSignal: emitted immediately before any change to
 *   oscillator parameters that affect tick timing or mapping (e.g., drift/rate,
 *   phase/offset, or origin).
 * - postOscillatorStateChangedSignal: emitted immediately after such a change.
 * - numTicksChangedSignal: emitted when the total tick count since origin (as
 *   observable through the mapping) changes due to a state update. Implementations
 *   SHOULD NOT emit this per actual tick in real time.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - getComputationOrigin() <= current simulation time.
