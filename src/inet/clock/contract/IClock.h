/**
 * This class defines the interface for clocks. See the corresponding NED file for details.
 *
 * The typical way to use a clock is to derive your class or module from either
 * ClockUserModuleBase or ClockUserModuleMixin. Then you can use the inherited
 * clock related methods or the methods of this interface on the inherited clock
 * field.
 *
 * The clock interface requires the following properties.
 *
 * 1. When a clock event is executed the clock time is guaranteed to be equal to
 *    the arrival clock time of the event.
 *
 * 2. The scheduling and the execution of a new independent clock event doesn't
 *    change the arrival simulation times (and of course arrival clock times) of
 *    all other events.
