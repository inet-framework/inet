/**
 * This class defines the interface for clocks. See the corresponding NED file for details.
 *
 * Terminology:
 * - Simulation time (t): OMNeT++'s global time axis.
 * - Clock time (c): time on this clock's own time axis.
 * - C(t): the (piecewise-monotone, right-continuous) mapping from simulation time to clock time,
 *         as defined by the current clock configuration and any past adjustments.
 *
 * General guarantees (unless the clock is explicitly modified between two simulation instants):
 *
 * 1) Monotonicity vs. simulation time:
 *    C(t) is non-decreasing in t. It may have jumps (e.g., when the clock is set),
 *    but it must not decrease unless an explicit modification is applied.
 *
 * 2) Clock events execute “on their clock”:
 *    When a ClockEvent is delivered, getClockTime() == the event’s arrival clock time.
 *
 * 3) Causality for scheduled events:
 *    The arrival clock time of any scheduled event is >= the current clock time
 *    at scheduling.
 *
 * 4) Consistency of absolute scheduling:
 *    For an event scheduled “at” a clock time c_a, its arrival simulation time t_a
 *    equals the (expected) simulation time at which C(t) reaches c_a according to
 *    the clock’s state at scheduling (subject to later clock adjustments; see below).
 *
 * 5) Dual consistency:
 *    At the arrival simulation time t_a of a scheduled event, the clock time equals
 *    the event’s arrival clock time (C(t_a) == c_a).
 *
 * About bounds at discontinuities:
 * - Some operations (e.g., setting the clock) can create instantaneous jumps in C(t).
 * - For conversions right at such instants, methods accept a `lowerBound` boolean to
 *   disambiguate which side of the jump to use:
 *     * lowerBound == true  → choose the lower value (left/“before the jump” side).
 *     * lowerBound == false → choose the higher value (right/“after the jump” side).
 *
 * Scheduling models:
 * - Absolute (“at”): anchoring to a specific clock time value. Later absolute changes
 *   to the clock (e.g., setClockTime, setOrigin) will shift the arrival simulation time.
 * - Relative (“after”): anchoring to a clock-duration from the scheduling instant.
 *   Later absolute changes to the clock do NOT change the arrival simulation time,
 *   but changes that affect the clock’s *rate* (drift) still do.
 *
 * Typical use:
 * - Derive from ClockUserModuleBase or ClockUserModuleMixin and call the inherited
 *   helpers or the methods below on the injected clock field.
