	Fixed the bug that the clock wasn't returning the *exact* clock time of clock
	events when they actually executed.

	Moved the contents of ClockTime.msg to contract and removed ClockTime from MSG file.
	All MSG files should use clocktime_t instead.

	Extracted the ClockEvent class to be a C++ class instead of it being generated.
	The reason is that it seems to have more and more custom code.
