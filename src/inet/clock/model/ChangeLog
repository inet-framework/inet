2021-11-08  Levente Mészáros

	Added @mutable property to parameters which can be changed during the simulation.

2021-07-22  Levente Mészáros

	Added timeChanged signal for the currently active time of the clock submodules.

2021-07-19  Levente Mészáros

	SettableClock: Changed resetting the tick offset to be optional, only if the
	oscillator supports this operation.

2021-07-14  Levente Mészáros

	Added MultiClock module that contains multiple clock submodules.

2021-04-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added/updated receiveSignal Enter_Method(): info is the signalname.

2021-04-09  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed the bug that the clock wasn't returning the *exact* clock time of clock
	events when they actually executed.

2021-04-07  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed for double arithmetic precision loss. Use integer arithmetic if possible.

2021-03-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	Changed if-else-if ladders in initialize() to separate if statements because
	different stages may have the same number.

2021-02-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	SettableClock: Fixed bug with big numbers, the calculation with doubles lost
	the precision.

2021-02-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added emits for recording time.

2021-01-22  Levente Mészáros

	SettableClock: Fixed note according to the clock interface documentation.

2021-01-11  ------ inet-4.3.0 released ------

2020-07-31  Levente Mészáros and Zoltán Böjthe

	Added new clock model package which supports the simulationo of hardware
	clocks with clock drift. See the User's Guide for more details.

	Added new modules: IdealClock, OscillatorBasedClock, and SettableClock.
