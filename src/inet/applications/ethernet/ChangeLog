2018-11-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	Removed unused obsolete EthernetApplication.

2018-11-12  Zoltan Bojthe

	Call socket->destroy() when the operation root module is not the containing node module.

2018-11-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Switched to socket.destroy() in handleCrashOperation().

2018-11-05  Zoltan Bojthe

	Close/abort socket at module crash operation.

2018-10-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added missing socket close calls for stop/crash handling.

2018-10-03  Zoltan Bojthe

2018-10-01  Zoltan Bojthe

	Removed obsolete registerDSAP from EtherAppClient.

	    MACAddress -> MacAddress

2017-12-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	Removed unnecessary cPar::doubleValue(), cPar::longValue() calls.

	Motivation: rely on cast operators instead because they can detect
	overflows (when the value is cast to a smaller integer type that can not
	represent it). Removed unnecessary .longvalue() calls. Replaced to
	.intValue() in comparisons.

2014-11-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	EtherAppCli: added localSAP, remoteSAP NED parameters
	EtherAppSrv: added localSAP parameter (use incoming SSAP as outgoing
	DSAP for replies)

2013-06-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherAppSrv: added lifecycle support

2013-06-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherAppSrv: moved registerSAP to stage 1 in initialize()
	and register SAP only when the node status is UP

	EtherAppCli: register DSAP and resolve dest MAC address at startTime
	instead initialize; always register DSAP

2013-06-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherTrafGen: resolve destination MAC address at startTime instead
	initialize

2013-04-25  Levente Meszaros

	Added ILifecycle support to most applications.

	All applications must either support lifecycle operations properly or
	throw an error when executing any lifecycle operations.

2011-12-21  Andras Varga

	statistics:
	- removed "stats" where "histogram" was already present (it implies "stats")
	- standardizing on lower case statistics titles
	- record packet counts in a less confusing way: as rcvdPk:count instead
	  of packetBytes(rcvdPk):count or rcvdPkBytes:count; total bytes is now
	  recorded as rcvdPk:sum(packetBytes)

2011-12-06  Andras Varga

	ethernet: added EtherTrafGen and EtherHost2

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	eliminate some warnings: variable set but not used

2011-08-15  Andras Varga

	Adapted units to recent OMNeT++ change: replaced Kbps,KB,MB,GB with
	kbps,KiB,MiB,GiB

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	apps: added/renamed parameters: 'sendInterval', 'stopTime'

	Renamed the following parameters to 'sendInterval':
	- messageFreq, waitTime, packetInterval, interval, waitInterval

	Added stopTime parameter to several apps:
	- TelnetApp, UDPBasicApp, TCPBasicClientApp, IPvXTrafGen, EtherAppCli

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Zoltan Bojthe

	code style, #include changes

2011-03-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	change simsignal_t member variables to static member

2011-03-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	#include, code style, strtok -> cStringTokenizer

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	@statistic: added missing 'vector' recording mode

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	update for omnet++ 4.1b3:

	renamed @signal to @statistic modeHint= to record=

2010-02-22  Zoltan Bojthe

	convert statistics to use signals

2010-06-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	use signals for statistics recording

2009-07-21  Andras Varga

	added default icons (mostly to *App modules)

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	more gate labels added; also, fixed case of TCPOut gates (i.e. they got
	renamed to tcpOut)

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2004-09-16  Andras Varga

	Initial checkin of EtherAppCli and EtherAppSrv, written as part of the
	Ethernet model.

	If you are interested in the early history of the code, change
	to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- Applications/Ethernet INET/src/applications/ethernet
