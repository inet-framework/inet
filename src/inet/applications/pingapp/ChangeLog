2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)

	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

2013-08-22  ------ inet-2.2.0 released ------

2013-07-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	PingApp: throw error only if node is down and receives a self message. Other
	incoming messages are dropped silently.

2013-07-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	- stopTime checks changed: send packet when simTime() <= stopTime
	(some apps tested "simTime() < stopTime", another apps tested "simTime()
	<= stopTime")

	- optimizations for the case where stopTime == -1

2013-05-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed "count" parameter in PingApp: -1 now means forever. Added test cases
	for all combinations of node startup/shutdown and ping app start/stop
	sequences.

2013-05-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	- lifecycle: Enter_Method_Silent() was missing in some
	  handleOperationStage() function

	- Added NodeStatus::DOWN checks for initialize()

2013-04-27  Levente Meszaros

	Initial lifecycle support

	All application must either support lifecycle operations properly or
	throw an error when executing any lifecycle operations.

2013-04-18  Levente Meszaros

	- Changed stopTime to use -1 to run the application forever.
	- PingApp: send pings only between start and stop, and when the node is
	  up.
	- Added test cases for all combinations of node startup/shutdown and ping
	app start/stop sequences.

2013-04-12  Zoltan Bojthe

	PingApp: various changes

	- added display string
	- added constructor/destructor for init/deinit pointers
	- timer deleted only in destructor
	- starttime/stoptime usage: start at latest of startTime and uptime if
	  earlier than stopTime

2013-03-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	PingApp, PingTestApp: removed init stages

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

2012-09-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	pingapp: show destination address at finish()

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-08-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Fixed an issue when ping replies were coming from "ext" interfaces.
	Ping was previously using the creation time of the message to
	calculate the RTT. Now we are storing the last n messages's
	sendTime in a circuler buffer so we can get the correct message age
	when we receive the response.

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-03-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added PingTestApp for testing the connectedness of the network.

2011-12-21  Andras Varga

	PingApp: turn off printPing by default

2011-12-21  Andras Varga

	PingApp: @statistics revised

	Renaming:
	- pingTx/pingRx -> pingTxSeq/pingRxSeq
	- endToEndDelay -> rtt (original name was misleading)
	- delayStat (C++) -> rttStat (original name was misleading)

	Drop/outOfOrderArrival statistics changed:

	- drop -> numLost; meaning changed: now it emits/records the count
	  (note: may also DECREASE not only increase)
	- outOfOrderArrival -> outOfOrderArrivals: now it emits/records the
	  count and not the rtt as before (???)
	- fix: out-of-order arrivals are no longer counted twice (both as "drop"
	  and as "outOfOrder")

	@statistics:
	- standardizing on lower case statistics titles
	- revised recording modes (e.g. "histogram" and "stats" do not make
	  sense together, as "histogram" already collects count, mean, stddev,
	  min, max, etc that stats does)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	NEDDOC fixes

2011-08-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	PingApp: move address resolving from initialize() to first send().

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	apps: added/renamed parameters: 'sendInterval', 'stopTime'

	Renamed the following parameters to 'sendInterval':
	- messageFreq, waitTime, packetInterval, interval, waitInterval

	Added stopTime parameter to several apps:
	- TelnetApp, UDPBasicApp, TCPBasicClientApp, IPvXTrafGen, EtherAppCli

2011-06-08  Rudolf Hornig

	from jesjones (#329): way to disable the large amounts of spam this
	module generates and adds a numPongs watch.

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-03-31  Zoltan Bojthe

2011-03-03  Zoltan Bojthe

2011-03-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	features: TCP_NSC, TCP_lwip, IPv6 completed

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2010-12-17  Zoltan Bojthe

	PingApp: add statistics

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	@statistic: added missing 'vector' recording mode

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	update for omnet++ 4.1b3:

	renamed @signal to @statistic modeHint= to record=

2010-02-22  Zoltan Bojthe

	convert statistics to use signals

2010-06-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	use signals for statistics recording

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-08-04  Andras Varga

	Complete rewrite of PingApp, taken over from IPv6SuiteWithINET

2003..2004  Andras Varga

	IPSuite extensive refactoring, see networklayer/ipv4/ChangeLog

2003-09-23  Andras Varga

	Initial checkin of IPSuite's PingApp module.
