HttpTools Project
=================

The project was created at Reykjavik University, the Laboratory for Dependable
Secure Systems (LDSS). The goal was to create a set of OMNeT++ components to
simulate browsing behaviour in a high-fidelity manner along with a highly
configurable Web server component.

HttpTools is described in:

    Jonsson, K., HttpTools: "A Toolkit for Simulation of Web Hosts in OMNeT++."
    In proceedings of the 2nd OMNeT++ workshop, Rome, Italy, 2009.

The toolkit consists of three components which plug into the INET framework:
- HttpBrowser simulates a single Web browser.
- HttpServer simulates a single Web server.
- HttpController manages the scenario.

A single controller object must be created at the scenario level in each
simulation which uses the HttpTools components. Any number of nodes with
browser or server components can be created (within the limits of memory
constraints, processing power and general sanity!). Nodes can be
interconnected using OMNeT++ communications links and the INET TCP/IP
networking stack implementation or use direct message passing to eliminate
the network effects altoghether.

Simulated HTTP messages are utilized by the browser and server components.

Two hosts can be used for the browser and server components:

StandardHost from the INET framework should be used if a full network
simulation using the TCP/IP stack is desired.

DirectHost is a part of HttpTools and should be used for hosts which use
direct message passing.
