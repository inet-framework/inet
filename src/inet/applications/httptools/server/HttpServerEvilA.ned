package inet.applications.httptools.server;

//
// Demonstrates subclassing the server to create a custom site. This site is an attacker -- a puppetmaster --
// which serves HTML pages containing attack code. In this case, we are simulating JavaScript attack code which prompts
// the unsuspecting browser to request a number of images from a victim site. Delays are specified to simulate hiding
// the attack from the browser user by use of JavaScript timeouts or similar mechanisms.
// The generateBody virtual function is redefined to create a page containing the attack code.
//
// This module definition has two additional parameters to the standard HttpServerDirect definition:
// * minBadRequests specifies the lower bound on bad requests caused to be sent to the victim by the browser.
// * maxBadRequests specifies the upper bound on bad requests caused to be sent to the victim by the browser.
