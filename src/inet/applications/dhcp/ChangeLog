	DHCPServer and Client: Major changes made both in client's and
	server's state machine. It is now extended with new states INIT-REBOOT
	and REBOOTING and with new message types DHCPNAK and DHCPDECLINE.

	With the new REBOOTING states scenarios with lifecycle events
	now work correctly.

	The server's performance modeling has been removed. The inner
	representation of the DHCP options are moved to a DHCPOptions
	INET message definition file.

	The client module currently does not support multiple DHCP servers
	and BOOTP relay agents.

	The whole implementation has been rewieved to bring it closer to
	the standards defined in RFC 2131 and 2132.
