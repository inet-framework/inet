2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	ev->EV and related OMNeT++ 5.0 logging compatible fixes

2013-11-18 Benjamin Seregi

	DHCPServer and Client: Major changes made both in client's and
	server's state machine. It is now extended with new states INIT-REBOOT
	and REBOOTING and with new message types DHCPNAK and DHCPDECLINE.

	With the new REBOOTING states scenarios with lifecycle events
	now work correctly.

	The server's performance modeling has been removed. The inner
	representation of the DHCP options are moved to a DHCPOptions
	INET message definition file.

	The client module currently does not support multiple DHCP servers
	and BOOTP relay agents.

	The whole implementation has been rewieved to bring it closer to
	the standards defined in RFC 2131 and 2132.
