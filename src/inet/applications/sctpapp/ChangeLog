2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	statistics:
	- SCTPClient/SCTPPeer: renamed "sentEchoedPk" to "echoedPk"
	- standardizing on lower case statistics titles
	- record packet counts in a less confusing way: as rcvdPk:count instead
	  of packetBytes(rcvdPk):count or rcvdPkBytes:count; total bytes is now
	  recorded as rcvdPk:sum(packetBytes)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	eliminate some warnings: variable set but not used

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	SCTPPeer: add constructor/destructor, move some code from finish() to
	destructor

	 - also revise map cleanings

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for cppcheck

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	SCTP: bugfixes: too small buffers, map::iterator incrementation after
	erase

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	SCTP apps: cosmetics

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	SCTPServer: fix: 'socket' local var was used instead of class member

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	SCTP apps: refactoring: more concise parsing of "localAddress" param

	Use cStringTokenizer and IPvXAddressResolver for parsing.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	SCTP apps: address/port to localAddress/localPort

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	SCTP apps: cosmetics: space changes, removal of unused types, etc.

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	comments, whitespace, etc.

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	SCTP apps: fix: changed int/double echoFactor to bool echo

	echoFactor was declared as int/int32/double at various places, but was
	used as a bool (so it was not a "factor" at all.)

	Renamed to 'echo', and changed the type to 'bool'

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Interfaces renamed to start with I.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	Code style changes:

	- tab-to-space conversion
	- '{' to new line
	- too long lines
	- remove trailing whitespace from lines
	- indentation
