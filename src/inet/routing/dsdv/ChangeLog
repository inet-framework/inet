	Takeover from INETMANET @ fff5dfd

	Follow IPv4Route change: "host" in IPv4Route was renamed to
	"destination"

	Follow RoutingTable change: returned IPv4Route pointers are no longer
	const

	DSDV_2: timeToLiveRoutingEntry NED parameter renamed to routeLifetime

2012-01-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Moved DSDV-related fields/functions from RoutingTable to DSDV_2.

	DSDV route expiry is now implemented with a new isValid() method on
	IPv4Route; RoutingTable will ignore invalid routes (isValid()==false).

	Details:
	- remove DSDV related fields/functions from the IPv4Route, IRoutingTable,
	  and RoutingTable classes
	- added new DSDVIPv4Route class that extends IPv4Route with DSDV-related
	  fields: expiryTime, sequencenumber (changed installtime to expirytime)
	- add IPv4Route::isValid() that compares simTime() to expiryTime
	- rename dsdvTestAndDelete() in RoutingTable to purge() -- it throws out
	  invalid routes using isValid()
	- remove set/getTimeToLiveRoutingEntry() functions from IRoutingTable
	- DSDV changed to add entries to the routing table with 255.255.255.255 netmask
	- DSDV to use DSDVIPv4Route entries

2012-01-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	DSDV_2: bugfix for #497: dynamic routing protocols (manetrouting)
	modify routing entries. Solution: remove routing entry and add a new one,
	instead of modifying the existing route.

	[Note: this fix is no longer needed, as a later RoutingTable/IPv4Route
	change makes it possible to change routes on the fly.]

	comments, whitespace, etc.

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe
