2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2015-01-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-26  Levente Meszaros

	Fixed memory management problems found by valgrind memcheck.
	The arrays were not correctly initialized, because j was occasionally
	incremented twice in the loop.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	backport: OLSR/OLSR_ETX: bugfix in initialize()

2013-09-27  Andras Varga

	ev.printf is going to be removed in OMNeT++ 5.0

2013-09-20  Andras Varga

	ev->EV and related OMNeT++ 5.0 logging compatible fixes

	olsr, dymo, dsr, dsdv, batman, aodv, olsr, dsdv: synced with INETMANET
	manetbase: introduced GlobalWirelessInspector, updated manet base.

	Z.B.: remove GlobalWirelessLinkInspector; added/fixed parameter units

2013-02-20  Andras Varga

	const fixes (in OMNeT++ 5.0, check_and_cast<> no longer silently
	discards const modifier)

	Takeover from INETMANET @ fff5dfd

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	manet compile fix: a const std::set<> can only be iterated with
	const_iterator

	It appears to be a bug in gcc that it accepts plain iterator (only for
	std::set though, the same with std::vector or std::map causes an error).

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	apps: renamed address/port params to localAddress/localPort where
	appropriate

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent thoughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I didn't touch external code that was ported into INET and is likely
	 to be updated in the future with newer versions: aodv-uu, dsr-uu,
	dymoum,
	 lwIP, etc.

	- I used omnetpp\_scripts\tidymodel\spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	rename IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-04-20  Rudolf Hornig

	Initial takeover of MANET routing protocols from INETMANET.
