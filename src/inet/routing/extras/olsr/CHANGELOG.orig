UM-OLSR CHANGELOG


==================
 v0.8.7 -> v0.8.8 
==================

* Better default configuration:

  - Piggybacking of up to 4 OLSR messages in a single packet. You can change
    this value by redefining OLSR_MAX_MSGS.
    
  - IPv4 addresses length is used by default. You can use the length of IPv6
    addresses by defining OLSR_IPv6.

  - Now needed changes are made in Makefile.in instead of Makefile.

* Removed the silly management of expired timers.

* Fixed a memory leak in OLSR::rm_link_tuple (thanks Sebastian Speicher :)
