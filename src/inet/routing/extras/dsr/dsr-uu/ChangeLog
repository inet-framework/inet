2014-12-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2015-01-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	Initial takeover of MANET routing protocols from INETMANET.

0.1:
	* Initial release.
0.2:
	* Added spec file.
	* Compilation fixes for kernel 2.6.12 on FC4
	* Fixed segmentation fault on module load on newer 2.4 kernels.
	* Fixed bug in dsr_srt_find_addr that made automatic route
	shortening not always work.
	* Properly initialize grat_rrep_tbl.
	* Fixed locking bugs in dsr-rreq.c
	* Compile fixes for kernel > 2.6.14
	* DSR now doesn't attach to a slave device until receiving a
	NETDEV_REGISTER event for that device.
	* Non IP packets are now freed in dsr_dev_start_xmit() and the
	dsr_dev usage count should be correct when unregistering the device.
