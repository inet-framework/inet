0.1:

	* Added spec file.
	* Compilation fixes for kernel 2.6.12 on FC4
	* Fixed segmentation fault on module load on newer 2.4 kernels.
	* Fixed bug in dsr_srt_find_addr that made automatic route
	shortening not always work.
	* Properly initialize grat_rrep_tbl.
	* Fixed locking bugs in dsr-rreq.c
	* Compile fixes for kernel > 2.6.14
	* DSR now doesn't attach to a slave device until receiving a

	dsr_dev usage count should be correct when unregistering the device.
