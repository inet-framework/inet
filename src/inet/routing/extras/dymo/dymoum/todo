==================
 DYMOUM TODO List 
==================


* Currently the implementation only allows one message on a DYMO packet. When
  supporting multiple messages we'll need to complete (at least)
  dymo_generic.c::generic_process_message() and
  dymo_generic.h::generic_postprocess().

* Change the packet format to the new generic packetbb spec.

* Prefix and gateway stuff is not supported right now. Thus,
  rtable.c::rtable_find(addr) does not perform longest-prefix matching yet.

* Change routing table data type from a double linked list to a hash table.

* Actions after sequence number loss. Maybe this isn't needed or it isn't very
  important in our case.
