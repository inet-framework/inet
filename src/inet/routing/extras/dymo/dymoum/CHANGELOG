==================
 DYMOUM CHANGELOG
==================


 v0.2 --> v0.3
===============

* Sequence numbers stuff has been changed to comply with draft 05.

* RERRs are only sent when the broken route has been used.

* Added simple link monitoring via HELLO messages. Just set a hello_ival
  greater than 0 to enable it.

* Now routes to the previous hop when a RE is received are only set if the
  S bit is active. See an explanation in dymo_re.c.

* DYMO_MAX_NR_INTERFACES is now the same in kdymo_main.c and in defs.h.

* Route updates were never happening in Linux version because there was an
  unregistered netfilter hook. Fixed.


 v0.1 --> v0.2
===============

* RE processing has been changed to support draft-03 spec.

* S-bit stuff is introduced to avoid unidirectional links. It's implemented
  via ICMP ECHOREPLY messages.

* Other several minor changes.
