====== inet-3.x ======

2015-06-22  ------ inet-3.0.0 released ------

2015-05-13  ------ inet-2.99.1 released ------

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2015-01-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

2012-02-11  Rudolf Hornig

	Takeover from INETMANET @ fff5dfd

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	Compile fix: a const std::set<> can only be iterated with const_iterator

	It appears to be a bug in gcc that it accepts plain iterator (only for
	std::set though, the same with std::vector or std::map causes an error).

2012-01-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	DYMOUM: use 255.255.255.255 netmask for routes.

	Before it used the IP address class' netmask.

2012-01-11  Zoltan Bojthe

	DYMOUM: Removed compatibility code for older OMNeT++ versions
	(INET itself requires OMNeT++ 4.2)

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	DYMOUM: added TODO note in the code that etherType should be
	filled in on outgoing packets (missing ctrl->setEtherType(...) call)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all INET classes.
	See base/ChangeLog for details.

2011-08-02  Andras Varga

	cosmetics

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for cppcheck

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	ctrl always a valid pointer (check_and_cast), don't need the check

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixing memory fill

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	use `twoAddressFrame' instead `frame'. The `frame' was NULL always.

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixing iterator usage after erase()

2011-07-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	MACAddress, ManetRouting, Ieee80211Mesh: Fixes for changed internal
	MACAddress representation from unsigned char[6] to uint64.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files
