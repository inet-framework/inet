	Takeover from INETMANET @ fff5dfd

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	Compile fix: a const std::set<> can only be iterated with const_iterator

	It appears to be a bug in gcc that it accepts plain iterator (only for
	std::set though, the same with std::vector or std::map causes an error).

2012-01-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	DYMOUM: use 255.255.255.255 netmask for routes.

	Before it used the IP address class' netmask.

2012-01-11  Zoltan Bojthe

	DYMOUM: Removed compatibility code for older OMNeT++ versions
	(INET itself requires OMNeT++ 4.2)

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	DYMOUM: added TODO note in the code that etherType should be
	filled in on outgoing packets (missing ctrl->setEtherType(...) call)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixing memory fill

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	use `twoAddressFrame' instead `frame'. The `frame' was NULL always.

	fixing iterator usage after erase()

2011-07-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	MACAddress, ManetRouting, Ieee80211Mesh: Fixes for changed internal
	MACAddress representation from unsigned char[6] to uint64.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Andras Varga
