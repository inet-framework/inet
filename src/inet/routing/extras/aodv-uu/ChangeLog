2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all INET classes.
	See base/ChangeLog for details.

	manetrouting: compile fixes for linux

2011-07-27  Andras Varga

	manetrouting: compile fixes for MSVC

	debug_aodv.h: there seems to have been some confusion around the DEBUG
	macro. Rewrote it as to what I think was the original intent: the DEBUG
	variable should control whether we want logging or not, and the same
	macro is used throughout the code for log statements.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

	Initial takeover of MANET routing protocols from INETMANET.
