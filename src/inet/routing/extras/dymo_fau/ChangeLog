2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2015-01-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

2012-01-17  Zoltan Bojthe

	DYMO: redesigned timers:

	The old code generated 5 timer messages for each routing entry, 1 timer
	message for each RREQ list entry, and 2 timer messages for SeqNumLoss.
	It was inefficient and also generated a big chaos in elog.

	The new code uses only one periodic timer message that goes off every
	1 sec, and triggers the expiry check of all entries in the table.
	(It is enough to check once per second whether a route or RREQ
	has timed out, because their lifetime is normally several seconds).

	Also: a series of small, cosmetic changes

	inetmanet@fff5dfd manetrouting: Full takeover of MANET protocols from
	the INETMANET repo

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all INET classes.
	See base/ChangeLog for details.

2011-09-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	for bug #373: UDP_I_ERROR message/ctrl leak

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for cppcheck

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	remove bad and unused constructor

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Andras Varga
