	backport: IPv4Route: renamed source to sourceType, getSource to
	getSourceType, setSource to setSourceType

2014-01-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	backported registerProtocol

2014-01-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	backport: MANET protocols backport (uses ipv4::netfilter)

2013-12-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	ICMPv4: sendErrorMessage(): better check for multicast/broadcast dest
	address -- fingerprints changed

	We must not send ICMP error in reply to any bcast/mcast packet, but
	network-directed bcasts (e.g. 10.0.0.255) were checked for.

2013-08-22  ------ inet-2.2.0 released ------

2013-05-03  Alfonso Ariza Quintana

	manet: synced with INETMANET (20130503)

	olsr, dymo, dsr, dsdv, batman, aodv, olsr, dsdv: synced with INETMANET
	manetbase: introduced GlobalWirelessInspector, updated manet base.

	Z.B.: remove GlobalWirelessLinkInspector; added/fixed parameter units

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

2012-11-23  Zoltan Bojthe

	ManetroutingBase:
	- updated documentation
	- Removed:
	    - unused ManetTimer and BatmanTimer class
	    - unused static variables
	    - isIpLocalAddress(), uses isLocalAddress()
	    - convertAddressToString()
		- removed getXPos(), getYPos() functions, you should use
	      getPosition() instead.

	- redesigned coordinate and speed storage and access
	  replaced double x,y with a Coord.  getDirection() returns the
	  speed vector (in Coord)
	- getters returns UNSPECIFIED_ADDRESS if addrType==UNDEFINED

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-06-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	IPv4Route: removed RouteType type field, and getType(), setType()
	functions, too

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-02-11  Rudolf Hornig

	Takeover from INETMANET @ fff5dfd

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	ManetRoutingBase: compile fix: a const std::set<> can only be iterated
	with const_iterator

	It appears to be a bug in gcc that it accepts plain iterator (only for
	std::set though, the same with std::vector or std::map causes an error).

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	ManetRoutingBase: follow IPv4Route change: "host" in IPv4Route was
	renamed to "destination"

2012-01-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	ManetRoutingBase: follow RoutingTable change: returned IPv4Route
	pointers are no longer const

2012-01-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	ManetRoutingBase: added some FIXMEs/TODOs

2012-01-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	ManetRoutingBase: removed setTimeToLiveRoutingEntry() / getTimeToLive-
	RoutingEntry() utility functions. (This is a change related to
	DSDV-related fields/functions being moved from RoutingTable to DSDV)

2012-01-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	manetrouting: use 255.255.255.255 netmask for routes

	Before it used the IP address class' netmask.

2012-01-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	ManetRoutingBase: bugfix for #497: dynamic routing protocols (manetrouting)
	modify routing entries. Solution: remove routing entry and add a new one,
	instead of modifying the existing route.

	[Note: this fix is no longer needed, as a later RoutingTable/IPv4Route
	change makes it possible to change routes on the fly.]

2012-01-11  Zoltan Bojthe

	ManetRoutingBase: Removed compatibility code for older OMNeT++ versions
	(INET itself requires OMNeT++ 4.2)

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	ManetRoutingBase: added TODO note in the code that etherType should be
	filled in on outgoing packets (missing ctrl->setEtherType(...) call)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-07-19  Levente Meszaros

	Follow refactoring of mobility modules.

	See ChangeLog in the mobility directory for details.

2011-07-27  Andras Varga

	manetrouting: compile fixes for MSVC

	debug_aodv.h: there seems to have been some confusion around the DEBUG
	macro. Rewrote it as to what I think was the original intent: the DEBUG
	variable should control whether we want logging or not, and the same
	macro is used throughout the code for log statements.

2011-07-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	MACAddress, ManetRouting, Ieee80211Mesh: Fixes for changed internal
	MACAddress representation from unsigned char[6] to uint64.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-04-28  Rudolf Hornig

	Added Mesh network support to Ieee80211

2011-04-27  Rudolf Hornig

	INET now compiles with MANET turnened off.

2011-04-20  Rudolf Hornig

	Initial takeover of MANET routing protocols from INETMANET.
