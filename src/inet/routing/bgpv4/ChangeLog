2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Directory restructuring:
	- code moved from networklayer/bgpv4/ to routing/bgpv4/

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet::bgp namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	BGPRouting: lifecycle operations not supported

2012-11-08  Zoltan Bojthe

	Minor optimizations

	Bugfix: The text "sets the ConnectRetryTimer to zero" means: restart this
	timer. The _connectRetryTime member now stores the timeout value (typically 120s)

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	IPv4Route: member variables made private, updated OSPFv2 and BGP
	accordingly

	OSPFv2 and BGP had redundant getters/setters in OSPFRoutingTableEntry
	etc, they were removed

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	Adapted to change: "host" in IPv4Route renamed to "destination"

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-09-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	bug #347: fixes some compiler warnings.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-04-19  Rudolf Hornig

	BGP: global functions are now members. Minor renamings.

2011-04-18  Andras Varga

	BGPRouting: cosmetics

2011-04-18  Andras Varga

	BGPRouting cosmetics

	- removed unused return value from loadConfigFromXML()
	- findMyAS(): take "out" parameter by reference, not by pointer

2011-04-18  Rudolf Hornig

	BGP: Use IF table to determine my AS id.

2011-04-15  Rudolf Hornig

	BGP model changes. BGP is now an ITTCPApp.

2011-03-17  Zoltan Bojthe

	Features: BGP: dependency, include

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	TCP datatransfermode fixes

2010-12-20  Zoltan Bojthe

	modify initialization order in constructor (eliminate compiler warning)
