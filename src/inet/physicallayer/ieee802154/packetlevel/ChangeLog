	Fixing Ieee802154NarrowbandScalarRadio

	Several minor fixes to the ned file:
	- The bandwidth was not correct, leading to incorrect channel allocation
	- The PHY header was calculated wrong
	- The base type was wrong

	Radio: Added support for the simulation of separate signal parts.

	The preamble, header and data parts can be optionally simulated
	separately. This is results in more accurate simulation, because a
	reception may be aborted before the data part is received.

	802.15.4 UWBIR: Moved under bitlevel, because it actually simulates the
	bits.

2015-03-16  Levente Meszaros

	Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
	separate subdirectories. Renamed ieee802154 to ieee802154/packetlevel.

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-12-08  Florian Meier

	Fixed physical layer characteristics.

	Signed-off-by: Florian Meier <florian.meier@koalo.de>

2014-12-02  Florian Meier

	Added an IEEE 802.15.4 Narrowband Physical and Link Layer.

	Default settings for the MAC are taken from the 802.15.4-2006 standard.
	Uses BreakpointPathLoss taken from 802.15.4-2006 Standard Annex E.
	Default radio settings are taken from the datasheet of the ATmega256RFR2.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-10-31  Levente Meszaros

	Copied implementation from MiXiM.
	Renamed a few things and did some minor cosmetics.
