	Renamed carrierFrequency to centerFrequency.

	This confusion was spread all around the code. In most places we don't
	know what kind of modulation is used (e.g. OFDM has several subcarriers),
	so it doesn't really make sense.

2019-08-27  Levente Mészáros

	Replaced simtime_t type with simsec in multidimensional analog domain signal representations.

2019-07-29  Gyorgy Szaszko

	Added some example frequencyGains values.

2019-06-07  Levente Mészáros

	Replaced old multidimensional mappings (MiXiM) with new multidimensional functions.
	This patch affects member variables, arguments and returns values.

2019-04-26  Daniel Stolpmann

	Set analog model of Ieee802154NarrowbandDimensionalRadioMedium to DimensionalAnalogModel.

2019-01-28  ------ inet-4.1.0 released ------

2018-09-26  Levente Mészáros

	Extracted Ieee802154NarrowbandRadio.
	Added sensible default values for transmitter/receiver submodule types in radio modules.
	Moved sensible default for antenna submodule type to Radio.
	Moved sensible default values for propagation and path loss submodules of the radio medium.

2018-09-25  Levente Mészáros

	Changed carrierFrequency parameter to use a default value to allow overriding it.
	Added dimensional transmitter/receiver/radio variants.

2018-06-05  Levente Mészáros

	Replaced fooType NED parameters with foo.typename parameters.

2018-01-26  Levente Mészáros

	Replaced headerBitLength with headerLength where the unit is already present.

2017-12-22  ------ inet-3.99.2 released ------

2017-12-20  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renaming:
	    APSKErrorModel -> ApskErrorModel

2017-11-16  ------ inet-3.99.1 released ------

2017-01-26  Levente Mészáros

	Switched to bit type where appropriate.

2017-01-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed macFrame to packet where appropriate.

2017-01-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	Replaced cPacket* with Packet* where appropriate.

2016-06-30  Florian Kauer

	Fixed Ieee802154NarrowbandScalarRadio.

	Several minor fixes to the ned file:
	- The bandwidth was not correct, leading to incorrect channel allocation
	- The PHY header was calculated wrong
	- The base type was wrong

2015-11-12  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added support for the simulation of separate signal parts.

	The preamble, header and data parts can be optionally simulated
	separately. This is results in more accurate simulation, because a
	reception may be aborted before the data part is received.

	802.15.4 UWBIR: Moved under bitlevel, because it actually simulates the
	bits.

2015-03-16  Levente Meszaros

	Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
	separate subdirectories. Renamed ieee802154 to ieee802154/packetlevel.

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-12-08  Florian Meier

	Fixed physical layer characteristics.

	Signed-off-by: Florian Meier <florian.meier@koalo.de>

2014-12-02  Florian Meier

	Added an IEEE 802.15.4 Narrowband Physical and Link Layer.

	Default settings for the MAC are taken from the 802.15.4-2006 standard.
	Uses BreakpointPathLoss taken from 802.15.4-2006 Standard Annex E.
	Default radio settings are taken from the datasheet of the ATmega256RFR2.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-10-31  Levente Meszaros

	Copied implementation from MiXiM.
	Renamed a few things and did some minor cosmetics.
