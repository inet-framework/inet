//
// This radio model provides a very simple but fast and predictable physical
// layer behavior. It must be used in conjunction with the ~UnitDiskRadioMedium
// model.
//
// The idea behind this radio model is to describe transmissions with a few
// distance based parameters: communication range, interference range, and
// detection range. Whether the reception is successful or not, depends on the
// distance between the transmitter and the receiver. This model is similar to
// the unit disk radio, but it's also more general than that. The ideal model
// also supports an ideal communication channel where all transmissions are
// received sucessfully independent of distance and interfering transmissions.
//
// See also ~UnitDiskRadioMedium, ~UnitDiskAnalogModel, ~UnitDiskTransmitter, and
// ~UnitDiskReceiver.
