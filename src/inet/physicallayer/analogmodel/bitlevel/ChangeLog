    Added arrival parameter to computeReceptionPower.

2015-04-03  Levente Mészáros

    Added level parameter to printToStream functions.

2015-03-19  Levente Mészáros

    Added LayeredDimensionalAnalogModel and factored out common parts.

    Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
    separate subdirectories. Renamed analogmodel/layered to analogmodel/bitlevel.
    Moved remaining analogmodel contents to analogmodel/packetlevel.

	Added a completely new layered radio (physical layer) implementation.

	The term layered means that the radio is capable of simulating the
	processing steps of the packet domain, bit domain, symbol domain, sample
	domain, and analog domain in detail. The architecture supports setting
	the level of detail independently of other parameters.

	The new layered model contains the IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer packet
	domain, bit domain, and symbol domain functions: including scrambling,
	forward error correction, interleaving, and modulation.

	There's also a simple hypothetical layered radio that makes the
	understanding of the architecture easier.

	Added Initial implementation for layered medium and signal analog models:
	SignalAnalogModel, ScalarSignalAnalogModel, DimensionalSignalAnalogModel,
	LayeredScalarAnalogModel
