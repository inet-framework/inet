	Dropped  dummy code from Ieee80211OFDMModulator and fixed polarity vector
	indexing.

	Added a completely new layered radio (physical layer) implementation.

	The term layered means that the radio is capable of simulating the
	processing steps of the packet domain, bit domain, symbol domain, sample
	domain, and analog domain in detail. The architecture supports setting
	the level of detail independently of other parameters.

	The new layered model contains the IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer packet
	domain, bit domain, and symbol domain functions: including scrambling,
	forward error correction, interleaving, and modulation.

	There's also a simple hypothetical layered radio that makes the
	understanding of the architecture easier.

	Added a detailed physical layer error model that is able to compute erroneous
	packet domain, bit domain and symbol domain signal representations.

	Added the following new classes:
