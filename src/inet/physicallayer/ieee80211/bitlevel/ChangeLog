	Added a completely new layered radio (physical layer) implementation.

	The term layered means that the radio is capable of simulating the
	processing steps of the packet domain, bit domain, symbol domain, sample
	domain, and analog domain in detail. The architecture supports setting
	the level of detail independently of other parameters.

	The new layered model contains the IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer packet
	domain, bit domain, and symbol domain functions: including scrambling,
	forward error correction, interleaving, and modulation.

	There's also a simple hypothetical layered radio that makes the
	understanding of the architecture easier.

	Added a detail implementation for the IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer
	according to the IEEE 802.11-2012 specification. The model supports various
	packet domain, bit domain and symbol domain functions.

	Added the following new classes:
	Ieee80211OFDMTransmitter, Ieee80211OFDMReceiver
	Ieee80211OFDMEncoder, Ieee80211OFDMEncoderModule,
	Ieee80211OFDMDecoder, Ieee80211OFDMDecoderModule
	Ieee80211ConvolutionalCode,
	Ieee80211Interleaver, Ieee80211InterleaverModule, Ieee80211Interleaving
	Ieee80211OFDMModulator, Ieee80211OFDMModulatorModule,
	Ieee80211OFDMDemodulator, Ieee80211OFDMDemodulatorModule
	Ieee80211OFDMSymbol, Ieee80211OFDMSymbolModel
