2015-04-15  Levente Mészáros

    Added snir parameter to computeReceptionDecision.

2015-04-09  Levente Mészáros

    Changed with isReceptionSuccessful to be true if all nested packets are free
    of errrors. Replaced default 802.11 mode with the one received in the control
    info.

2015-04-03  Levente Mészáros

    Added level parameter to printToStream functions.

2015-04-02  Benjamin Seregi

    Renamed Ieee80211Interleaver to Ieee80211OFDMInterleaver.

2015-03-20  Benjamin Seregi

    Ieee80211LayeredOFDMTransmitter: changed pad bitlength computation. The
    previous version was also correct but this computation method is more
    close to the standard.

2015-03-19  Benjamin Seregi

    Dropped dummy code from Ieee80211OFDMModulator and fixed polarity vector
    indexing. Added support for 5/6 code rate to Ieee80211ConvolutionalCode.

2015-03-16  Levente Mészáros

    Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
    separate subdirectories. Renamed ieee80211/layered to ieee80211/bitlevel.
    Moved remaining ieee80211 contents to ieee80211/packetlevel.

2015-02-25  Benjamin Seregi

	Added a completely new layered radio (physical layer) implementation.

	The term layered means that the radio is capable of simulating the
	processing steps of the packet domain, bit domain, symbol domain, sample
	domain, and analog domain in detail. The architecture supports setting
	the level of detail independently of other parameters.

	The new layered model contains the IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer packet
	domain, bit domain, and symbol domain functions: including scrambling,
	forward error correction, interleaving, and modulation.

	There's also a simple hypothetical layered radio that makes the
	understanding of the architecture easier.

	Added a detail implementation for the IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer
	according to the IEEE 802.11-2012 specification. The model supports various
	packet domain, bit domain and symbol domain functions.

	Added the following new classes:
	Ieee80211OFDMTransmitter, Ieee80211OFDMReceiver
	Ieee80211OFDMEncoder, Ieee80211OFDMEncoderModule,
	Ieee80211OFDMDecoder, Ieee80211OFDMDecoderModule
	Ieee80211ConvolutionalCode,
	Ieee80211Interleaver, Ieee80211InterleaverModule, Ieee80211Interleaving
	Ieee80211OFDMModulator, Ieee80211OFDMModulatorModule,
	Ieee80211OFDMDemodulator, Ieee80211OFDMDemodulatorModule
	Ieee80211OFDMSymbol, Ieee80211OFDMSymbolModel
