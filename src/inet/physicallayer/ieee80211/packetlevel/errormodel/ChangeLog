====== inet-4.x ======

2018-06-27  ------ inet-4.0.0 released ------

2018-05-04  Levente Mészáros

	Extended error models with corruption mode parameter.

	Available corruption modes: packet, chunk, byte, or bit level. 802.11
	error models support packet corruption mode only but could be extended
	with the others to do real MPDU aggregation.

2018-04-26  Alfonso Ariza

	Added HT and VHT modes to Nist and Yans error models.

	Renaming:
	    APSKModulationBase -> ApskModulationBase
	    BPSKModulation -> BpskModulation
	    ISNIR -> ISnir
	    Ieee80211OFDMMode -> Ieee80211OfdmMode
	    QAM16Modulation -> Qam16Modulation
	    QAM64Modulation -> Qam64Modulation
	    QPSKModulation -> QpskModulation

2017-11-16  ------ inet-3.99.1 released ------

2017-10-30  Levente Mészáros

	Extended 802.11 layered error model for packet level simulation.
	Changed 802.11 OFDM error models wrt. to the service field.
	The service field is part of the PHY header in terms of bits but it's
	sent in the data part in terms of symbols (modulation).

2017-01-26  Levente Mészáros

	Switched to bit type where appropriate.

	Added 'g(erp)' mode set and renamed 'g' to 'g(mixed)' for disambiguation.
	Currently we don't have a mechanism to dynamically negotiate ERP only networks.

	Ieee80211Consts.h: remove unnecesary includes of it

2015-11-12  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added support for the simulation of separate signal parts.

	The preamble, header and data parts can be optionally simulated
	separately. This is results in more accurate simulation, because a
	reception may be aborted before the data part is received.

	Ieee80211ErrorModelBase, Ieee80211{Nist,Yans}ErrorModel: removed chunk
	mode abstraction.

2015-02-24  Levente Meszaros

	Removed header success rate calculation from Ieee80211BerTableErrorModel.
	The returned packet error rate value should already include all possible
	header errors. Updated fingerprints.

	Refactored 802.11 error models to reflect recent changes in the mode descriptors.
	Introduced bps and Hz units where appropriate. Extracted
	Ieee80211BerTableErrorModel as a separate error model. Removed opMode and
	autoHeaderSize parameters for Ieee80211NistErrorModel and
	Ieee80211YansErrorModel. They rather use the meta data on the transmission.

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-28  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: end-line spaces removed, using spaces.pl in OMNeT++.

2011-05-11  Andras Varga

	Compile fixes for MSVC

	- disambiguate arg types for pow(), sqrt(), etc. (ambiguity caused
	compile errors)
	- added implementations for missing C99 functions
	- MSVC does not have <stdint.h>, but most of its declarations are
	already provided by <omnetpp.h>

2011-04-15  Rudolf Hornig

	Added new ieee802.11 model from INETMANET, supporting a,b,g,p modes.
