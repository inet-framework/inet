2015-11-12  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added support for the simulation of separate signal parts.

	The preamble, header and data parts can be optionally simulated
	separately. This is results in more accurate simulation, because a
	reception may be aborted before the data part is received.

2015-11-12  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added a simplified 802.11 model using ideal transmissions and
	medium.

2015-05-13  ------ inet-2.99.1 released ------

2015-04-03  Levente Meszaros

	Added check for number of antennas. Added level parameter to printToStream
	functions.

2015-03-19  Levente Meszaros

	Added checks for matching the used Ieee80211Mode in the mode set.
	Fixed to use the right IIeee80211Mode to compute the header bit length.
	Renamed the old Radio80211aControlInfo into Ieee80211ReceptionIndication.
	Added Ieee80211TransmissionRequest with an optional IIeee80211Mode parameter.
	This allows the mac module to determine the exact physical layer operational
	mode.

2015-03-16  Levente Meszaros

	Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
	separate subdirectories. Renamed ieee80211/layered to ieee80211/bitlevel.
	Moved remaining ieee80211 contents to ieee80211/packetlevel.

2015-02-25  Levente Meszaros

	Replaced opMode and preambleMode members with Ieee80211Mode in
	Ieee80211*Transmitters/Iee80211*Transmissions.

	Added initial implementation:
	Ieee80211OfdmCode, Ieee80211OfdmModulation

	Moved classes related to the layered implementation into the layered directory:
	Ieee80211Interleaver, Ieee80211Scrambler

	Deleted obsolete 802.11 modulation.

2015-02-24  Levente Meszaros

	Removed kludgie header length calculation from 802.11 transmitters.
	For example, the old code incorrectly calculated with 24 bits (instead of
	48 bits) long header length in DSSS mode. Updated fingerprints.
	Removed header success rate calculation from Ieee80211BerTableErrorModel.
	The returned packet error rate value should already include all possible
	header errors. Updated fingerprints.
	Added new 802.11 PHY mode description classes.

2015-02-17  Levente Meszaros

	Replaced double with simtime_t in duration computations to avoid rounding
	errors. Removed superfluous, weird and precision loosing time conversion.
	Updated fingerprints.

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-12-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-10-31  Levente Meszaros

	Added initial implementation:
	BerParseFile, Ieee80211DimensionalReceiver, Ieee80211DimensionalTransmitter,
	Ieee80211DimensionalTransmission, Ieee80211Modulation,
	Ieee80211Radio, Ieee80211ScalarReceiver, Ieee80211ScalarTransmitter,
	Ieee80211ScalarTransmission, Radio80211aControlInfo, Ieee80211Scrambler,
	Ieee80211Interleaver
