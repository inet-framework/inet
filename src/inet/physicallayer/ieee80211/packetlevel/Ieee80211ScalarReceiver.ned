// This receiver model receives an IEEE 802.11 transmission successfully if the
// minimum of the signal to noise and interference ratio over the duration of
// the reception is sufficiently high. It uses one of the IEEE 802.11 specific
// error models to compute the error rate based on this value and the used
// operation mode.
