    Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations
    into separate subdirectories. Renamed base/layered to base/bitlevel. Moved
    remaining base contents to base/packetlevel.

	Added a completely new layered radio (physical layer) implementation.

	The term layered means that the radio is capable of simulating the
	processing steps of the packet domain, bit domain, symbol domain, sample
	domain, and analog domain in detail. The architecture supports setting
	the level of detail independently of other parameters.

	The new layered model contains the IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer packet
	domain, bit domain, and symbol domain functions: including scrambling,
	forward error correction, interleaving, and modulation.

	There's also a simple hypothetical layered radio that makes the
	understanding of the architecture easier.

	Added a layered error model base class that provides functions to compute
	the erroneous packet model, bit model and symbol model depending on the
	simulated level of detail.

	Added new class: LayeredErrorModelBase
