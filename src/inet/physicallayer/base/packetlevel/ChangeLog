====== inet-3.x ======

2015-02-25  Levente Meszaros

	Added modulation base classes:
	APSKModulationBase, DPSKModulationBase, GFSKModulationBase, MQAMModulationBase, PPMModulationBase

2015-02-24  Levente Mészáros

	Extracted classes from narrowband radio: FlatRadioBase, FlatTransmitterBase,
	FlatTransmissionBase, FlatReceiverBase, FlatReceptionBase
	Fixed initstages for transmitters/receivers.

2015-02-04  Levente Mészáros

	Refactored the interface and implementation of modulations.

	Modulations now support the calculation of BER and SER. Added a number of
	new base classes, interfaces and various implementations. Some
	implementations are still incomplete.

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-12-02  Florian Meier

	Copied DSSS-OQPSK-16 modulation from MiXiM.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-10-31  Levente Meszaros

	Added initial implementation:
	AntennaBase, AttenuationBase, ErrorModelBase, FlatNoiseBase,
	FlatReceiverBase, FlatReceptionBase, FlatTransmissionBase,
	FlatTransmitterBase, ListeningBase, NoiseBase, PhysicalLayerBase,
	PropagationBase, ReceiverBase, ReceptionBase, SNIRBase, SNIRReceiverBase,
	TransmissionBase, TransmitterBase
