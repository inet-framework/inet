2015-12-08  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Fixed PER computation in NetworkConfiguratorBase.

	Added computeReceptionIndication to IReceiver interface.

2015-12-08  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added some documentation and a few missing overrides.

2015-11-12  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added support for the simulation of separate signal parts.

	The preamble, header and data parts can be optionally simulated
	separately. This is results in more accurate simulation, because a
	reception may be aborted before the data part is received.

2015-11-12  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added separate preambleDuration parameters to transmitters.

2015-06-22  ------ inet-3.0.0 released ------

2015-05-13  ------ inet-2.99.1 released ------

2015-04-15  Levente Meszaros

	Added snir parameter to computeIsReceptionSuccessful. Added snir parameter
	to computeReceptionDecision. Added arrival parameter to computeReceptionPower.

2015-04-03  Levente Meszaros

	Added basic antenna array support. Added level parameter to printToStream
	functions.

2015-03-18  Levente Meszaros

	Fixed memory management by delaying allocation.

2015-03-16  Levente Meszaros

	Extracted DimensionalTransmitterBase class. This change fixes compilation
	with individual radio features turned off.

2015-03-16  Levente Meszaros

	Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
	separate subdirectories. Renamed base/layered to base/bitlevel. Moved
	remaining base contents to base/packetlevel.

2015-02-25  Levente Meszaros

	Added modulation base classes:
	APSKModulationBase, DPSKModulationBase, GFSKModulationBase, MQAMModulationBase, PPMModulationBase

2015-02-24  Levente Meszaros

	Extracted classes from narrowband radio: FlatRadioBase, FlatTransmitterBase,
	FlatTransmissionBase, FlatReceiverBase, FlatReceptionBase
	Fixed initstages for transmitters/receivers.

2015-02-04  Levente Meszaros

	Refactored the interface and implementation of modulations.

	Modulations now support the calculation of BER and SER. Added a number of
	new base classes, interfaces and various implementations. Some
	implementations are still incomplete.

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-12-02  Florian Meier

	Copied DSSS-OQPSK-16 modulation from MiXiM.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-10-31  Levente Meszaros

	Added initial implementation:
	AntennaBase, AttenuationBase, ErrorModelBase, FlatNoiseBase,
	FlatReceiverBase, FlatReceptionBase, FlatTransmissionBase,
	FlatTransmitterBase, ListeningBase, NoiseBase, PhysicalLayerBase,
	PropagationBase, ReceiverBase, ReceptionBase, SNIRBase, SNIRReceiverBase,
	TransmissionBase, TransmitterBase
