 - support capturing a stronger signal while receiving a weaker one
 - support aborting an ongoing transmission
 - add the simulation of synchronization process (pilot/preamble)
 - add missing Weibull and Jakes fading
 - add multipath support
 - add real CUDA and multi-core parallel execution
 - add deep learning (neural-network) based wireless physical layer error model
 - add parameter for bit error estimation: based on min(packet), mean(packet), min(mean(symbol))
 - use shared pointers for transmissions/receptions, etc. because the gui copies packets in the packet log and inspects them later
 - factor out physical layer analog domain representation into a separate parameter of transmissions

 - "receive" multiple signals simultaneously without prefering one or the other when they start at the same time but in different events, same for simply overlapping signals, that is the radio should evaluate all and pick the one after the signals end and make sure it only recives one at a time! 
 - where should the radio check for incorrect (corrupted) PHY headers? this is completely missing right now, should this be done from the receiver or the radio class (probably before decapsulation)?
   in general, setting the bit error flag in the packet is not an option, because it might lose the fine detail of a corrupted packet (e.g. chunk level or bit level corruption)
   in addition to MAC CRC, PHY headers may also contain parity bits and/or CRC, so a radio should probably be able to stop receiving a signal right after the header and skip the data part altogether   

 - review dup calls for performance reasons, verify if they are justified
 - extract analog model from transmission/reception to avoid having too many classes
 - always add a PhyFrame, even in the simple case? or better yet rename RadioFrame to PhyFrame and make them the transmission/reception the analog model of it
 - rename speed to velocity (speed is scalar)
 - rename loss to gain?
 - consider renaming sensitivity to minReceptionPower, or some other unification
 - consider generalizing the implementation from radio to radio/cable physical layer with naming, directories etc.
 - create a new interface for stream like transmitters/receivers (transmissionStart, transmissionEnd, receptionStart, receptionEnd)
 - provide capture during reception (switching to another transmission)
 - remove those interfaces which are unlikely to have multiple different implementations
 - we don't know the end position at the time of the transmission begin, we can only have a guess
   should we separate transmission begin and end? or should it be an approximation only?
 - using random numbers during computing the radio signal reception decisision is fundamentally wrong because the computation is not purely functional anymore and thus prevents deterministic concurrent parallel computing (because the order of random number generation matters)
   to solve this issue we might use multiple random number generators (one for each worker) and/or request receivers to provide an upper limit for the count of random numbers needed to be able to deterministically provide them   
 - TwoRayGroundReflection: when not using any ground model the simulation crashes without any explanation
 - TwoRayInterference: should use ground model. if not using, it should assume ground elevation to be 0
 - revise adding separate transmission/reception started/ended signals to Radio similarly to how RadioMedium emits them right now
 - cleanup terminology related to reception started: is it the arrival of the first bit of the signal, or is the start of the attempted reception process
