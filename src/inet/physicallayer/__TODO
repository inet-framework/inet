 - rename speed to velocity (speed is scalar)
 - rename loss to gain?
 - consider renaming sensitivity to minReceptionPower, or some other unification
 - consider generalizing the implementation from radio to radio/cable physical layer with naming, directories etc.
 - create a new interface for stream like transmitters/receivers (transmissionStart, transmissionEnd, receptionStart, receptionEnd)
 - extend receiver interface to allow a separate decision for the detection of preambles during synchronization
 - provide capture during reception (switching to another transmission)
 - remove those interfaces which are unlikely to have multiple different implementations
 - we don't know the end position at the time of the transmission begin, we can only have a guess
   should we separate transmission begin and end? or should it be an approximation only?
 - using random numbers during computing the radio signal reception decisision is fundamentally wrong because the computation is not purely functional anymore and thus prevents deterministic concurrent parallel computing (because the order of random number generation matters)
   to solve this issue we might use multiple random number generators (one for each worker) and/or request receivers to provide an upper limit for the count of random numbers needed to be able to deterministically provide them
