 * This interface represents a physical device (a part of the radio) which converts
 * electric signals into packets.
 *
 * The receiver interface supports optimistic parallel computation of reception
 * results. For this reason some functions are marked to be purely functional.
 * Unfortunately this cannot be enforced by the compiler in C++. We really need
 * to be very careful regarding this, because it's pretty easy to break the purely
 * functional API just be reading a non-const member variable. As a rule of thumb
 * these functions must be qualified with const and all of their parameters must
 * also be qualified with const. Moreover they are forbidden to access any state
 * that can change over time to avoid non-deterministic behavior. These functions
 * may be called from background threads running parallel with the main simulation
 * thread. They may also be called several times due to cache invalidation before
 * the actual result is needed. This process is controlled by the medium.
