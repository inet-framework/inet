2023-01-23  Levente Mészáros

	Extended analog models to provide separate durations for preamble, header, and data in the reception.
	Changed LayeredDimensionalAnalogModel to use the LayeredSnir representation.
	Implemented the separation of preambleDuration, headerDuration and dataDuration in layered signal model.
	Added special ISnir implementation for layered radio models.

	Added evFlags parameter to all printToStream methods and recursive calls.

2020-08-25  Levente Mészáros

	Changed EV output to use the new EV_FIELD macro where appropriate.

2020-06-04  Levente Mészáros

	Added & to const Coord where appropriate.
	Added & to const Quaternion where appropriate.

2019-09-23  Levente Mészáros

	Renamed carrierFrequency to centerFrequency.

	This confusion was spread all around the code. In most places we don't
	know what kind of modulation is used (e.g. OFDM has several subcarriers),
	so it doesn't really make sense.

2019-08-27  Levente Mészáros

	Replaced simtime_t type with simsec in multidimensional analog domain signal representations.

2019-06-07  Levente Mészáros

	Replaced old multidimensional mappings (MiXiM) with new multidimensional functions.

	This patch affects member variables, arguments and returns values.

2019-01-28  ------ inet-4.1.0 released ------

2018-12-21  Levente Mészáros

	Added ignorePartialInterference parameter to scalar analogue models.

	This parameter allows ignoring interfering signals which have partially
	overlapping frequency domain analog representation. For example, a Wifi
	signal using adjacent channels. This parameter is disabled by default.

	Renaming:
	    DimensionalSNIR -> DimensionalSnir
	    ScalarSNIR -> ScalarSnir

	Added arrival parameter to computeReceptionPower.

	Added level parameter to printToStream functions.

2015-03-19  Levente Meszaros

	Added LayeredDimensionalAnalogModel and factored out common parts.

2015-03-16  Levente Meszaros

	Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
	separate subdirectories. Renamed analogmodel/layered to analogmodel/bitlevel.
	Moved remaining analogmodel contents to analogmodel/packetlevel.

2015-02-25  Benjamin Seregi & Levente Meszaros

	Added a completely new layered radio (physical layer) implementation.

	The term layered means that the radio is capable of simulating the
	processing steps of the packet domain, bit domain, symbol domain, sample
	domain, and analog domain in detail. The architecture supports setting
	the level of detail independently of other parameters.

	The new layered model contains the IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer packet
	domain, bit domain, and symbol domain functions: including scrambling,
	forward error correction, interleaving, and modulation.

	There's also a simple hypothetical layered radio that makes the
	understanding of the architecture easier.

	Added Initial implementation for layered medium and signal analog models:
	SignalAnalogModel, ScalarSignalAnalogModel, DimensionalSignalAnalogModel,
	LayeredScalarAnalogModel
