    Added QBPSKModulation modulation.

	Refactored the interface and implementation of modulations.

	Modulations now support the calculation of BER and SER. Added a number of
	new base classes, interfaces and various implementations. Some
	implementations are still incomplete.

	Moved existing modulation classes from common subdirectory: BPSKModulation,
	QPSKModulation, QAM16Modulation, QAM64Modulation and QAM256Modulation.
	Adapted these modulations to the new modulation interface. Reimplemented the
	calculateBER and calculateSER functions according to formulas found on
	wikipedia.

	Added an initial implementation for modulations used by the 802.11 PHY:
	DBPSKModulation, DQPSKModulation, 2GFSKModulation, 4GFSKModulation,
	4PPMModulation, 16PPMModulation

	Added an initial implementation for some other generic modulations:
	MASKModulation, MFSKModulation, MPSKModulation.
