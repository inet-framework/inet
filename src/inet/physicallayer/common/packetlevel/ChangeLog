2015-12-16  ------ inet-3.2.0 released ------

2015-12-08  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added some documentation and a few missing overrides.

2015-11-12  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added support for the simulation of separate signal parts.

	The preamble, header and data parts can be optionally simulated
	separately. This is results in more accurate simulation, because a
	reception may be aborted before the data part is received.

2015-11-27  Zoltan Bojthe

	Made the code compile with OMNeT++ 5.0b3

2015-10-26  ------ inet-3.1.1 released ------

2015-10-15  ------ inet-3.1.0 released ------

2015-06-22  ------ inet-3.0.0 released ------

2015-05-13  ------ inet-2.99.1 released ------

2015-04-23  Levente Meszaros

	Added radio medium lookup based on module parameter. Added snir parameter to
	computeReceptionDecision.

2015-04-13  Levente Meszaros

	Deleted duplicated code used in communication range computation.

2015-04-09  Levente Meszaros

	Moved setting the biterror from the medium to the decision. This is needed
	by the bitlevel model that computes biterrors in the deserializer.

	Added communication heat map to MediumVisualizer.
	Extracted MediumVisualizer from RadioMedium.

2015-04-03  Levente Meszaros

	Added level parameter to printToStream functions.

2015-03-30  Levente Meszaros

	Extracted MediumLimitCache from RadioMedium.

2015-03-24  Levente Meszaros

	Refactored the computation of communication figures. The new code simply
	computes the transformation matrix. Changed various line widths to unscaled.

2015-03-20  Levente Meszaros

	Extracted separate CommunicationLog class.

2015-03-18  Levente Meszaros

	Replaced the default communication cache. Fixed computation of medium limits
	during initialization.

2015-03-16  Levente Meszaros

	Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
	separate subdirectories. Renamed common/layered to common/bitlevel. Moved
	remaining common contents to common/packetlevel.

2015-03-02  Levente Meszaros

	Fixed memory managements bugs found by valgrind memcheck.

2015-02-25  Levente Meszaros

	Deleted obsolete ModulationClass, CodeRate, and ModulationType.
	Moved BPSKModulation, QPSKModulation, QAM16Modulation, QAM64Modulation and
	QAM256Modulation to modulation subdirectory and refactored them.

	Extended RadioMedium and ReceptionDecision to support optional PHY frames
	for the layered implementation.

	Moved classes related to the layered implementation into the corresponding
	layered directory: ConvolutionalCoder

2015-02-24  Levente Meszaros

	Refactored transmitPacket/receivePacket to support layered radio.
	Added separate and optional PHY frame representation.

2015-02-23  Levente Meszaros

	Fixed deleting interval entries from the interval tree.
	This bug caused the heap to grow indefinitely with the number of
	transmissions. Reported by Raphael Riebl <raphael.riebl@thi.de>

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2015-01-19  Levente Meszaros

	Fixed removing dynamic radios.

2015-01-12  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-26  Levente Meszaros

	Renamed classes to TransmissionRequest and ReceptionIndication.
	Moved them under the inet::physicallayer namespace.

2014-11-19  Levente Meszaros

	Added IntervalTree cache for efficiently computing arrivals.
	This drastically increases physical layer performance for large networks.

2014-11-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added noise and SNIR cache counters.

2014-11-12  Levente Meszaros

	Ignore incoming reception messages when down. Ignore aborting ongoing
	transmission when switching radio mode. Changed to switch radio mode
	immediately during startup/shudown/crash ignoring switching times.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-10-31  Levente Meszaros

	Added initial implementation:
	Arrival, BandListening, ConvolutionalCoder, FlatErrorModel, Interference,
	ListeningDecision, Modulation, ModulationType, Radio, RadioFrame,
	RadioMedium, ReceptionDecision
