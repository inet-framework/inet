	bugfix: corrected memory management issue in radio module

	Corrected a fatal bug in the radio module that can occur if the
	separateReceptionParts mode is used.
	 This fixes an invalid delete(void*) attempt that occurs if a packet
	reception ends while the radio is still switching from RX --> another
	mode. Previously the code was trying to use abortReception(cMessage*) on
	a packet that had already been processed with endReception(cMessage*). If
	your simulation was unlucky enough to encounter this case the simulator
	would segfault.

2018-01-12  Zoltan Bojthe

	Changed some module parameters from double to int.

	Radio: Added some documentation and a few missing overrides.

2015-11-12  Levente Meszaros

	Radio: Added support for the simulation of separate signal parts.

	The preamble, header and data parts can be optionally simulated
	separately. This is results in more accurate simulation, because a
	reception may be aborted before the data part is received.

2015-11-27  Zoltan Bojthe

	Made the code compile with OMNeT++ 5.0b3

	computeReceptionDecision.

2015-04-13  Levente Meszaros

	Deleted duplicated code used in communication range computation.

2015-04-09  Levente Meszaros
