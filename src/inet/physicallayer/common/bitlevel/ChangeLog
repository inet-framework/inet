	Radio: Added support for the simulation of separate signal parts.

	The preamble, header and data parts can be optionally simulated
	separately. This is results in more accurate simulation, because a
	reception may be aborted before the data part is received.

	Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
	separate subdirectories. Renamed common/layered to common/bitlevel. Moved
	remaining common contents to common/packetlevel.

	Added a completely new layered radio (physical layer) implementation.

	The term layered means that the radio is capable of simulating the
	processing steps of the packet domain, bit domain, symbol domain, sample
	domain, and analog domain in detail. The architecture supports setting
	the level of detail independently of other parameters.

	The new layered model contains the IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer packet
	domain, bit domain, and symbol domain functions: including scrambling,
	forward error correction, interleaving, and modulation.

	There's also a simple hypothetical layered radio that makes the
	understanding of the architecture easier.

	Added various common physical layer functions such as convolutional
	coding, scrambling, and default signal representations for the packet
	domain, bit domain, symbol domain, sample domain and analog domains.

	Added the following new classes:
	LayeredTransmission, LayeredReception, LayeredReceptionDecision
	SignalPacketModel, SignalBitModel, SignalSymbolModel, SignalSampleModel
	AdditiveScrambler, AdditiveScramblerModule, AdditiveScrambling
	ConvolutionalCode, ConvolutionalCoder, ConvolutionalCoderModule
	PulseFilter, PulseShaper
	AnalogDigitalConverter, DigitalAnalogConverter
