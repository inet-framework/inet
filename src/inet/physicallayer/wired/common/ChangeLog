	WireJunction: Added @wireJunction property for the Sequence Chart tool.

	This allows to recognize the top level wire junction modules and open
	their axes when the network node level filter is selected. Otherwise
	these modules are not open (because they are not full network nodes) and
	this prevents packet transmissions to be seen.
