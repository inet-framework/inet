	Radio: Added support for the simulation of separate signal parts.

	The preamble, header and data parts can be optionally simulated
	separately. This is results in more accurate simulation, because a
	reception may be aborted before the data part is received.

	Added snir parameter to computeReceptionDecision.

2015-04-03  Levente Meszaros

	Added level parameter to printToStream functions.

	Renamed APSKSerializer to APSKPhyFrameSerializer and adapted to new API.

2015-03-16  Levente Meszaros

	Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
	separate subdirectories. Renamed apsk/layered to apskradio/bitlevel. Moved
	remaining apsk contents to apsk/packetlevel.

	Added a completely new layered radio (physical layer) implementation.

	The term layered means that the radio is capable of simulating the
	processing steps of the packet domain, bit domain, symbol domain, sample
	domain, and analog domain in detail. The architecture supports setting
	the level of detail independently of other parameters.

	The new layered model contains the IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer packet
	domain, bit domain, and symbol domain functions: including scrambling,
	forward error correction, interleaving, and modulation.

	There's also a simple hypothetical layered radio that makes the
	understanding of the architecture easier.

	Added a simple hypothetical layered radio implementation that supports the
	simulation of various packet domain, bit domain and symbol domain functions.
	The main purpose of this radio is to show a simple but detailed physical
	layer implementation that is easy to understand.

	Added the new following new classes:
	APSKCode, APSKEncoder, APSKDecoder, APSKModulator, APSKDemodulator,
	APSKLayeredTransmitter, APSKLayeredReceiver,
	APSKSerializer, APSKSymbol
