	Consistently renamed packet level and bit level implementations into
	separate subdirectories. Renamed contract/layered to contract/bitlevel.
	Moved remaining contract contents to contract/packetlevel.

	Added a completely new layered radio (physical layer) implementation.

	The term layered means that the radio is capable of simulating the
	processing steps of the packet domain, bit domain, symbol domain, sample
	domain, and analog domain in detail. The architecture supports setting
	the level of detail independently of other parameters.

	The new layered model contains the IEEE 802.11 OFDM physical layer packet
	domain, bit domain, and symbol domain functions: including scrambling,
	forward error correction, interleaving, and modulation.

	There's also a simple hypothetical layered radio that makes the
	understanding of the architecture easier.

	Added common interfaces for various detailed physical layer functions
	such as FEC encoding/decoding, scrambling/descrambling,
	interleaving/deinterleaving, modulation/demodulation, etc. Also added
	generic interfaces for radio signal packet domain, bit domain, symbol
	domain, sample domain and analog domain representations.

	Added the following new interfaces:
	ISignalPacketModel, ISignalBitModel, ISignalSymbolModel,
	ISignalSampleModel, ISignalAnalogModel
	ILayeredErrorModel, ISymbol
	IEncoder ,IDecoder, IFECCoder, IInterleaver, IScrambler
	IModulator, IDemodulator,
	IPulseShaper, IPulseFilter
	IDigitalAnalogConverter, IAnalogDigitalConverter
