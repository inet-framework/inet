// This battery model maintains a residual charge capacity by integrating the
// difference between the total consumed current and the total generated current
// over time. This model uses a charge independent ideal voltage source and an
// charge independent internal resistance. It initiates node crash when the
// residual charge capacity reaches zero. See the base module for signals and
// statistics.
