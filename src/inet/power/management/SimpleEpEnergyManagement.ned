// This energy mangement model estimates the residual energy capacity of the
// energy source model by actually querying it. It is only useful when the
// estimation process is not important. This model initiates node shutdown
// when the residual capacity decreases below a threshold, and it also
// initiates node start when the residual capacity increases above another
// threshold.
