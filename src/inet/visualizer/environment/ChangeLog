	Added separate visualizer modules developed over the last year.
	Visualizer modules require at least OMNeT++ version 5.0, because
	of the use of new graphics APIs.

	There are separate visualizers for scene, network node, physical environment,
	mobility, radio medium, connectivity, links, routes, obstacle loss, and
	statistic. Added 3 visualizer modules for each model, one for cCanvas,
	another one for OSG, and a combined variant. Also added integrated
	visualizers that combine all known visualizers into a single module.
	Visualization code can be turned off/on as a whole, as it is a separate
	Project Feature (see .oppfeatures)

	Added implementation of the following classes:

	PhysicalEnvironmentCanvasVisualizer, PhysicalEnvironmentOsgVisualizer,
	PhysicalEnvironmentVisualizer.
