/**
 * Protocol dissector classes dissect packets into protocol specific meaningful
 * parts. The algorithm calls the visitor method exactly one time for each part
 * in order from left to right. For an aggregate packet all aggregated parts are
 * visited in the order they appear in the packet. For a fragmented packet the
 * fragment part is visited as a whole. If dissecting that part is also needed
 * then another dissector must be used for that part.
 *
 * Dissectors can handle both protocol specific and raw representations (raw
 * bytes or bits). In general, dissectors call the chunk visitor with the most
 * specific representation available for a particular protocol.
