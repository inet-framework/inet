2016-06-27  Rudolf Hornig

	build: create a precompiled header file when using gcc or clang This
	speeds up the build speed considerably. A precompiled.h.[pch|gch] file is
	created on demand. All .cc files are implicitly including the
	precompiled.h file as the first include.

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

2013-04-29  Andras Varga

	Interface operations (InterfaceOperation) removed for now

2013-04-27  Andras Varga

	AbstractQueue: added cancelService()

2013-04-27  Andras Varga

	Added lifecycle infrastructure: ILifecycle, LifecycleController,
	NodeStatus, etc.

	Lifecycle: for shutdown/crash/startup/etc, a LifecycleOperation (e.g.
	NodeShutdownOperation) is applied to the submodule tree of the  node
	(host or router) by LifecycleController. Each module can decide how to
	handle the operation and how to store the resulting state (up/down,etc).
	Operations can be multi-stage, and don't need to complete immediately
	(i.e. they can take nonzero simulation time and multiple events to
	complete).

	Network nodes now also have a status submodule (type NodeStatus) with
	the sole purpose of storing the whole node's status (up/down) and
	displaying it via icons.

	- classes: ILifecycle, LifecycleOperation (NodeOperation, InterfaceOperation),
	  LifecycleController, NodeStatus
	- NodeStatus module to store the network node's status (up or down)
	- added optional NodeStatus submodule to NodeBase
	- added a test for the basic Lifecycle infrastructure

2013-04-27  Andras Varga

	ModuleAccess: isNode() renamed to isNetworkNode()

2013-04-14  Andras Varga

	queues: added pop() to IPassiveQueue. It is useful for flushing queues
	in MACs when they go down. clear() is not good enough because we want
	to use packets as drop signal value.

2013-04-17  Andras Varga

	Removed obsolete classes QueueWithQoS and EnqueueHook

2013-04-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	PassiveQueueBase: optimization: removed the msgId2TimeMap, use
	msg->arrivalTime for calculating queueing time values instead

2013-03-21  Levente Meszaros

	ModuleAccess: findModuleUnderContainingNode() function

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

2012-11-22  Rudolf Hornig

	base: fixed bug #620. The module pointer returned by a ModuleAccess
	class is now cached only if get() was used. For get(module) no caching
	is done.

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-05-11  Tamas Borbely

	Add 'rcvdPk' signal to PassiveQueueBase. Now 'enqueuePk' signal
	is emitted only if the the packet was stored in the queue.

2012-04-26  Tamas Borbely

	IPassiveQueue: added methods to manage queue listeners.
	Listeners receives notifications about packet arrivals.
	These notifications are required by schedulers that
	join multiple queues.

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-03-01  Andras Varga

	Added createNode(), createLink() factory methods to Toplogy class.

	to NotifierConsts.h

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-02-11 Rudolf Hornig

	Takeover from INETMANET @ fff5dfd

	Added some notification codes in NotifierConstants.h for Access Point and
	Station association / disassociation

2012-02-04  Andras Varga

	base: added Topology

	This is a revised and expanded version of the OMNeT++ cTopology class.
	(Makes it possible to add/remove nodes and links, etc.)  We'll put this
	enhanced version back into OMNeT++ in the 4.3 version, but until then
	it's available here in INET.

	Changes:
	- renamed private data members (underscore to camelcase convention)
	- switched over to use STL containers internally instead of arrays
	- getNodeFor(): hand-made binary search replaced by std::lower_bound
	- new methods: addNode(), deleteNode(), addLink(), deleteLink()
	- added Node::setPayload()/getPayload() Note: now that nodes/links can
	be added that are not associated with modules and connections in the
	network, methods like getModule(), getLocalGate() etc may return NULL.

2012-01-09  Andras Varga

	NotifierConsts: added NF_IPv4_ROUTE_CHANGED and NF_IPv6_ROUTE_CHANGED
	notification (latter is unused yet)

2012-01-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	WeightedTopology now works with OMNeT++ 4.2 (without patching)

2011-12-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added WeightedTopology: it extends OMNeT++ cTopology, and adds
	weighted shortest path computation (needed for fixing #465)

	Requires OMNeT++ 4.2.1 or adding "friend class WeightedTopology;"
	to the cTopology::Node class

2012-01-05  Zoltan Bojthe

	Coord: remove "copy from a pointer" constructor

2012-01-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	Coord: bugfix for #484: return type of *=, /=, +=, -=, and = operators
	should be Coord& not Coord

	Also fixed includes: Need INETDefs.h for INET_API in class definition.

2011-12-21  Andras Varga

	Sink: revised "rcvdPk" statistic:
	- standardizing on lower case statistics titles
	- record packet counts in a less confusing way: as rcvdPk:count instead
	  of packetBytes(rcvdPk):count or rcvdPkBytes:count; total bytes is now
	  recorded as rcvdPk:sum(packetBytes)

2011-12-05  Andras Varga

	base: added NED function select(index,...)

	Returns the <index>th item from the rest of the argument list; numbering
	starts from 0.

2011-11-30  Andras Varga

	fix of #477: erfc() implementation moved out from header file INETDefs.h

2011-11-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	mobility: Added result filters for IMobility and Coord classes

	These filters need for recording node coordinataes in statistics.

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	Coord.h: minor optimization: use copy ctor instead of default ctor + op=

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all INET classes.

	Added a private copy() function per class (if needed) that contains the
	common part of operator= and the copy constructor.

	Added a private clean() function per class (if needed) that contains the
	original code of destructor.

	copy constructor
	================
	- explicitly calls base class copy constructor if there's a base class
	- calls copy

	<class>::<class>(const <class>& other) : <superclass>(other)
	{
	  //ptr = NULL; // if needed, and other initializations
	  copy(other);
	}

	operator=
	=========
	- checks this==&other if class is not abstract
	- calls clean() if need
	- calls base class operator= if there's a base class
	- calls copy
	- returns *this

	<class>& <class>::operator=(const <class>& other)
	{
	   if (this==&other) return *this; // omit if class is abstract
	   clean(); // omit if class hasnot clean() function
	   <superclass>::operator=(other); // omit if there is no base class
	   copy(other);
	   return *this;
	}

	copy
	====
	- is private, non-virtual and returns void
	- does not call base class'es copy or any copy constructor or any
	operator=

	void <class>::copy(const <class>& other)
	{
	  <pointer> = NULL;
	  <member> = 0;
	  // etc
	}

	clean
	====
	- is private, non-virtual and returns void
	- does not call base class'es clean function
	- C++ code copied from destructor usually

	void <class>::clean()
	{
	  delete <pointer>;
	  // etc
	}

	Mobility: fix bug in torus distance calculation

	The old version returned NaN when the size of any dimension was zero.

2011-09-15  Levente Meszaros

	Mobility: reflect mobility state changes in the visual representation
	module

	Renamed hostModule to visualRepresentation. Splitted positionUpdated
	into two functions to ease overriding. BasicModule subclasses (such as
	mobility modules) should be useable without a full blown host. Changed
	findHost to be able to return NULL if requested to do so. The default
	findHost behavior did not change.

2011-09-15  Levente Meszaros

	Mobility: fix a bug related to adding a Coord and a number

	This was possible, because C++ implicitly converted the number into a
	Coord by treating it as a 1 dimensional coordinate.

	Changed x and y arguments to be mandatory in the constructor. Added a
	default constructor to be able to initialize arrays. Renamed
	isInRectangle to better describe what it actually does.

2011-08-05  Andras Varga

	INETDefs.h: require at least OMNeT++ 4.2

	due to signals, cNEDValue, conditional submodules in NED, etc.

2011-08-03  Levente Meszaros

	Changed findHost to search for a module upwards having @node() property.
	Moved down NotificationBoard lookup.

	We don't want to require a host to always have a NotificationBoard.
	Looking up a NotificationBoard in BasicModule all the time is too
	restrictive.

2011-07-19  Levente Meszaros

	Refactored mobility modules.

	See ChangeLog in the mobility directory for details.

2011-07-19  Levente Meszaros

	Added 3D coordinate support from MiXiM.

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-07-07  Levente Meszaros

	Deleted the obsolete Blackboard.

2011-07-07  Levente Meszaros

	Extended ModuleAccess::get* functions with a module parameter.

	NEDFunctions.cc: updated for NED function changes

2011-06-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added new NED function: string moduleListByPath(string modulePath,...)

	Returns a space-separated list of the modules at the given path(s).
	Based on cTopology::extractByModulePath()

2011-06-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	MMapBoard removed (was not really used)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

	Compile fixes for MSVC

	- disambiguate arg types for pow(), sqrt(), etc. (ambiguity caused
	  compile errors)
	- added implementations for missing C99 functions
	- MSVC does not have <stdint.h>, but most of its declarations are
	  already provided by <omnetpp.h>

	Added plugin interfaces to the network layer to be able to add
	drop/duplicate modules, througput meters etc.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

	* NotificationBoard: added bool hasSubscribers(int category) method.
	By using a local boolean 'hasSubscriber' flag, it allows performance-
	critical clients to leave out calls to fireChangeNotification() if
	there's no one subscribed anyway. The flag should be refreshed on
	each NF_SUBSCRIBERLIST_CHANGED notification (newly added too).

	* INotifiable: receiveChangeNotification() signature change: details
	object pointer became "const"

	* NotifierConsts: added constants for overlay networks [from Ingmar
	Baumgart, OverSim]

	* AbstractQueue improved so that if serviceTime is zero, it does not
	  schedule a timer but sends out the message (i.e. invokes endService())
	  immediately

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

	* added FSMA.h (written by Levente Meszaros for the IEEE802.11 model)

	Initial checkin of QueueBase, AbstractQueue, Sink, Join	and other
	classes and modules as part of the IPSuite rewrite that resulted in
	the INET Framework; see src/networklayer/ipv4/ChangeLog for a
	detailed account.

	If you are interested in the early history of the code,
	change to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- src/base INET/src/base Base\n
