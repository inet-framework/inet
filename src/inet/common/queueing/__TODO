 - classifyPacketByData function corresponds to PacketByDataClassifier or ClassifyPacketByData class? which one? and rename all similar classes according to naming convention
 - remove txQueueLimit parameters from network interfaces which are only simply passed down to the MAC queue
 - using queue->getPacket(0) as the current transmission is generally wrong, because a new high priority packet might jump to the front of the queue
 - update NED documentation and User's Guide
 - PacketQueue -> RequestHandler -> ManualScheduler & PacketServer (timeLimit, dataLimit, packetLimit)
 - konnyu csatorna telites (pl ethernet interface), gateway module to stop/start packet flow, customizable request/response based applications
 - document PacketQueue cannot delay packets, if a packetqueue is not empty then it can be popped!
 - change all queue users (MACs) to: queue->pushPacket(), !queue->canPopSomePacket() && !isTransmitting(), startTransmitting(queue->popPacket)
 - add @loose to queue gates, remove connections unconnected from MAC modules
 - add signals and statistics to all packet queue modules!
 - ColorMarker, MarkerClassifier, MarkerScheduler, etc. coloring (ColorTag or MarkTag), lehetne olyan classifier/scheduler ami coloring alapjan megy
 - PacketServer-nek kell olyan parametere legyen, ami azt befolyasolja, hogy mikor servelhet, pl: csak kedden vagy amikor van token a bucket-ben

the following components could use subclassing:
 - Multiplexer = Classifier
 - Demultiplexer = Scheduler
 - Delayer = Server
 - Provider = Producer = Source
 - Collector = Consumer = Sink
 - Router = Demultiplexer + Classifier
 - Network = Router + Delayer + Router

questions:
 - should we support asynchronous external behaviour?
   DONE = keep this
 - should we support asynchronous internal behaviour?
   DONE = drop this feature
 - do we need this level of detail for the number of contract interfaces or use more functions in less interfaces?
   DONE = use several interfaces one for each kind of input and one for each kind of output
 - where module subtyping can be replaced with parameterization, should we do it?
   = we should, but we should also have the subtypes with the parameters set

queue signals and statistics:
 pushed, popped, dropped, generated, available
 pushed - dropped - removed - popped + generated = queue length = poppable (available) + delayed
queue parameters: storage order, drop strategy, pop strategy

naming convention:
 input:
 - push, pop -> absorber (push)
 - push, no pop -> consumer (push)
 - no push, pop -> collector ()
 output:
 - push, pop -> emitter (pop, request)
 - push, no pop -> producer ()
 - no push, pop -> provider (pop, request)

emitter -> absorber, consumer
producer -> absorber, consumer
provider -> absorber, collector

emitter, provider -> absorber
emitter, producer -> consumer
emitter, provider -> collector

queue (consumer, provider): (empty, getNum, get, remove)
 - input: push, no pop
 - output: no push, pop
 - can be asynchronous

classifier (consumer, producer):
 - input: push, no pop
 - output: push, no pop
 - can be asynchronous

scheduler (collector, provider):
 - input: no push, pop
 - output: no push, pop
 - can be asynchronous
 
filter (absorber, emitter):
 - input: push, pop
 - output: push, pop
 - can be asynchronous

duplicator (consumer, producer):
 - input: push, no pop
 - output: push, no pop
 - can be asynchronous

delayer (consumer, producer):
 - input: push, no pop
 - output: push, no pop
 - always asynchronous

processor:
 - input: no push, pop
 - output: push, no pop
 - alwyas asynchronous

channel ez nem a queue veletlenul?: olyasmi amibe pusholni lehet, de nem mindig csak amikor epp nem foglalt
 - input: push, no pop
 - output: no push, pop
 
leaky bucket/token bucket (= queue + server):
 - input: no push, pop
 - output: push, no pop
 - always asynchronous

multiplexer: one input to several output: cannot implement collection API
 - input: no push, pop
 - output: no push, pop

demultiplexer: several input to one output: cannot implement collection API
 - input: push, no pop
 - output: push, no pop

The queue API should simulatenously support the following:

different external structure:
 - queues as submodules without being connected to the outside world via gates
   the queue is not in the packet path, it's rather part of the processing module
 - queues which are connected to generators and consumers
   the queue is in the packet path

different modes of operation:
 - queues must be able to operate synchronously without utilizing handleMessage
   a packet getting into a queue may immediately cause another packet to get out from the queue
 - queues must be able to operate asynchronously with utilizing handleMessage
   this is the old INET 4.0 behaviour

abstraction via composition:
 - queues can be simple modules
 - queues can be composed from simple modules into compound queue modules

easy access:
 - protocols should be able to use queues without knowing what is the queue's
   module structure, mode of operation, simple or compound, etc.

DONE stop with an error during initialize if the connected components are not compatible (i.e. they won't work)
DONE priorityClassifier for multiple servers
DONE PacketQueue parameter for drop or canPush behaviour
DONE Extend API with gate parameters where applicable
DONE Valto (Scheduler, Classifier) transition matrix (probability, stay time)
DONE classifierFunction, classifierClass -> C++ macro
DONE remove references to IPassiveQueue
DONE ThresholdDropper --> PacketBuffer
DONE RedDropper single input/output gates + optional reference to PacketBuffer
