2015-04-08  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed fragmented packets in IPv4Serializer.

2015-03-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added support for EtherLLC, and EtherSNAP to EthernetSerializer.

2015-04-01  Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored the serialization of TCP options in TCPSerializer.

2015-04-01  Zoltan Bojthe

	UDPSerializer: verify checksum only if pseudo header data is available

2015-03-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added IGMPv3_REPORT to IGMPSerializer.

2015-03-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	Deserialize only packet length bytes in IPv4Serializer. Fixed serialization
	of header length.

2015-04-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added timestamps to Ieee80211Serializer.

2015-03-23  Levente Meszaros

	Replaced magic numbers with proper CRC calculations. CRC residue is not part
	of the standard, it's a hardware implementation detail. We couldn't find a
	reliable source how to use them, so we reverted back to simply recalculating
	the CRC value.

2015-03-12  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed ByteArrayMessage to RawPacket.

2015-03-11  Zoltan Bojthe

	IPv4Serializer serializes only true IPv4Datagrams, it doesn't serialize
	DSRPkt and DSRPktExt as IPv4Datagram.

2015-03-06  Levente Meszaros

	Added ByteArraySerializer, DefaultSerializer.

2015-02-20  Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored packet serializer classes to use a safe buffer class to read and
	write binary data. This allows parsing incorrect binary representations without
	runtime errors required by bit precise physical layer models.

	Refactored recursion in serializers to be extensible with new packet formats
	without modifying existing code. Fixed a number of packet length bugs and
	inconsistencies between serialized and non-serialized forms.

	Refactored the following serializers:
	TCPSerializer, SCTPSerializer, UDPSerializer,
	IPv4Serializer, ICMPSerializer, ARPSerializer, IGMPSerializer,
	IPv6Serializer, ICMPv6Serializer,
	EthernetSerializer, Ieee80211Serializer

2015-02-25  Benjamin Seregi

	Added 802.11 OFDM PHY frame serializer.

2015-01-28  Irene Ruengeler

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added implementation of IGMPv3.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the

	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

	subdirectories (ipv4/, tcp/, sctp/, etc.)

	thanks Ariza!

2009-12-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	Improved header serializers

	- multiple copies of the same checksum functions factored out into
	  TCPIPChecksum.h/cc
	- TCP header serializer/parser rewritten for better option management.
	- SCTPSerializer: checksum() renamed to crc32() because it's not the
	  same algorithm as the convential TCP/IP checksum
	- tcp.h: use fixed-size int types (uint16_t, etc) instead of
	  int/short/char
	- some whitespace change (tabs to spaces)

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2006-02-14  Andras Varga

	Initial checkin of headerserializers, from Christian Dankbar, Irene
	Ruengeler and Michael Tuexen.

	If you are interested in the early history of the code,
	change to the project root and type

	    Util/HeaderSerializers
