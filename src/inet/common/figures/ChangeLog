	Figures: Fixed ownership problems in figures that keep other figures
	around while they are detached.

	The detached figures are owned by their creator figure until they are
	added to the figure tree again.

2016-06-15  ------ inet-3.4.0 released ------

2016-05-17  Andras Varga

	Added instrument figures: GaugeFigure, LinearGaugeFigure,
	ProgressMeterFigure, ThermometerFigure, CounterFigure,
	IndicatorLabelFigurea and IndicatorTextFigure. These C++ types
	all implement IIndicatorFigure.

	Instruments display the value set on them via IIndicatorFigure.

	In practice, instrument figures are driven by signals, using a
	@statistic for converting emitted signals into calls to
	IIndicatorFigure's setValue() method. An example:

	  @figure[thruputMeter](type=gauge; pos=50,100; size=150,150);
	  @statistic[dummy](source=throughput; record=figure; targetFigure=thruputMeter);

	The first line adds a figure of the type GaugeFigure to the canvas,
	with the name thruputMeter. The second line adds a special "figure"
	result recorder for the throughput signal. The result recorder
	(see the FigureRecorder C++ class) sends every emitted value
	to the figure denoted by the targetFigure attribute of the
	@statistic, in this case thruputMeter.

	One issue is that @statistic can only add signal listeners to the
	current module (on which the @statistic is declared), but not to
	a submodule or sub-submodule. The workaround for this issue is
	to use a @delegatesignal property to "teleport" the signal from
	its emitted module to the module of the @statistic, under a new
	name. An example:

	  @delegatesignal[rcvdPk](source=hostB.udpApp[0].rcvdPk; target=hostB_rcvdPk);
	  @signal[hostB_rcvdPk];

	The first line adds a listener to the hostB.udpApp[0] submodule for
	the rcvdPk signal, and emits it on the current module as hostB_rcvdPk.
	A @statistic can then use hostB_rcvdPk as its source signal. The
	second, @signal line is necessary because OMNeT++ only allows declared
	signals to be emitted.

	IMPORTANT: When using @delegatesignal, the network must contain a
	DelegateSignalConfigurator module somewhere, because it is what
	processes those properties and makes them work.

	See the Wireless Tutorial (tutorials/wireless) for an example.
