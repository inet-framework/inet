	Removed cObject base class from Coord and EulerAngles.

	The reason why cObject was a base class was that we used to emit signals
	with coordinates, but that's not the case anymore. There are no virtual
	functions in those classes and cObject would introduce an unnecessary
	vptr.

2017-11-22  Levente Mészáros

	Added fields to Coord and EulerAngles MSG files.

2017-11-21  Levente Mészáros

	Added missing properties to Coord and EulerAngles.
	Renamed info() to str() in Coord.
	Added str() to EulerAngles.
	Removed @opaque from fields, and added @opaque to types where needed.

	Added Geometry.msg file.

	Visualizer: Added separate visualizer modules in a new toplevel folder.

	Added separate visualizers for scene, network node, physical environment,
	mobility, radio medium, connectivity, links, routes, obstacle loss, and
	statistic. Added 3 visualizer modules for each model, one for cCanvas,
	another one for OSG, and a combined variant. Also added integrated
	visualizers that combine all known visualizers into a single module.

	Also added "visualization" feature to .oppfeatures

2016-01-04  Levente Meszaros

	Added geographic coordinate systems:

	* module interface IGeographicCoordinateSystem, and modules
	  SimpleGeographicCoordinateSystem and OsgGeographicCoordinateSystem.

	* C++ interface IGeographicCoordinateSystem, and GeoCoord (latitude+
	  longitude+altitude)
