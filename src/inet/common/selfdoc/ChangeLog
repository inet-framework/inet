	Switch to use EXECUTE_PRE_NETWORK_SETUP().

	Previous, EXECUTE_ON_STARTUP()-based solution doesn't work with
	omnetpp-7, because new cSimulation object is created for each run.

	threads-support: added OPP_THREAD_LOCAL for rest of global vars
	where getSharedVariable()/getSharedCounter() was not appropriate.

	INET ported to omnetpp pre-7.0 master

	Follow API changes:
	- cSimulation: getSimulationStage() == CTX_CLEANUP  --> getStage() ==
	cSimulation::STAGE_CLEANUP
	- getSimulation() --> cSimulation::getActiveSimulation(), as global
	getSimulation() function became deprecated
	- some static cConfiguration methods became non-static
	- MacAddress: eliminate "getEnvir() deprecated" warnings from header
