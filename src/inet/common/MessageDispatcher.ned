package inet.common;

//
// This module connects multiple applications, protocols and interfaces with
// each other and automatically dispatches messages and packets between them.
// It allows many different configurations from layered architectures where
// message dispatchers separate different communication layers to centralized
// architectures where a single message dispatcher is connected to all components.
//
// Configuring the dispatch mechanism:
//  - protocols must register by calling registerService and/or registerProtocol
//  - interfaces must register by calling registerInterface
//  - sockets must register by sending socket messages
//  - packets must have tags attached which specifie the destination protocol, interface or socket
//
