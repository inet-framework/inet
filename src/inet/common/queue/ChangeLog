====== inet-3.x ======

2015-06-22  ------ inet-3.0.0 released ------

2015-05-13  ------ inet-2.99.1 released ------

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

====== inet-2.x ======

2014-01-22  Levente Meszaros

	Moved queue modules from linklayer because they are independent of it.

2013-10-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	backport: registerSignal() calls moved from initialize() to static
	variable declaration

2013-04-14  Andras Varga

	queues: added pop() to IPassiveQueue

	Useful for flushing queues in MACs when they do down. clear() is not good
	enough because we want to use packets as drop signal value.

2015-03-04  ------ inet-2.6 released ------

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.5.1 released ------

2014-10-29  ------ inet-2.5.0 released ------

2014-10-29  Thomas Dreibholz

    improved REDDropper, in order to provide a functionality similar to the old REDQueue.
    (allows specifying avearge packet rate that is used for calculation when the queue is empty)

2014-06-12  ------ inet-2.4.0 released ------

2014-03-19  ------ inet-2.3.0 released ------

2013-08-22  ------ inet-2.2.0 released ------

2013-04-14  Andras Varga

	queues: added pop() to IPassiveQueue

	Useful for flushing queues in MACs when they go down. clear() is not
	good enough because we want to use packets as drop signal value.

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-05-16  Tamas Borbely

	Old queuing components has been removed:
	 - DropTailQosQueue
	 - REDQueue
	 - WeightedFairQueue
	 - IQoSClassifier (moved to linklayer/ieee80211/mac)
	 - BasicDSCPClassifier
	Some of them can be substituted by compound modules composed
	of these newly added components:
	 - FIFOQueue
	 - REDDropper
	 - ThresholdDropper
	 - PriorityScheduler
	 - WRRScheduler
	For example REDQueue is a combination of a REDDropper and a FIFOQueue,
	and DropTailQosQueue is a combination of some classifier, DropTailQueues,
	and a PriorityScheduler.

2012-04-26  Tamas Borbely

	DropTailQueue: name of the inner queue can be specified by
	a parameter. This is useful when a compound module contains
	multiple queues, and you want to specify one of them in
	the 'q' tag of the display string.

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-02-10  Andras Varga

	added WeigthedFairQueue from INETMANET (following some formatting and
	C++ improvements)

2011-12-22  Andras Varga

	statistics revised:

	- added dropPk and queueingTime
	- changed statistics titles to lowercase
	- add "max" recording mode to places where "timeavg" was present and
	  it is appropriate
	- fix: interpolationmode should be used with @statistic and not with
	  @signal
	- remove "histogram" recording from queue length statistics (makes
	  no sense), added "timeavg" instead
	- removed "stats" where "histogram" was already present (as it implies
	  "stats")

2011-08-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	removed NoQueue (NICs now use queueType="" to select the internal queue)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	BasicDSCPClassifier: fix

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-04-12  Rudolf Hornig

	Refactoring in Ethernet and PPP interfaces. NoQueue can be used also as
	queueType parameter. Added support for input and output hooks in NICs.

2011-03-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	change simsignal_t member variables to static member

2011-03-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	Features: IPv4 - milestone 1

2011-03-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	features: TCP_NSC, TCP_lwip, IPv6 completed

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Interfaces renamed to start with I.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	removed obsolete and misleading !WORK_IN_PROGRESS! files

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	removed redundant (long) conversion from emit() calls

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	@statistic: added missing 'vector' recording mode

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	update for omnet++ 4.1b3:

	renamed @signal to @statistic modeHint= to record=

2010-06-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	convert statistics to use signals

2010-06-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Add isEmpty() functions to IPassiveQueue and its child classes

2010-06-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	indent changes - from Thomas Reschka

2009-07-19  Andras Varga

	added further module @labels (ethernet-node, wireless-node, mpls-node);
	added default icons to several module types

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-07-09  Andras Varga

	* all queue modules: performance: remember output gate pointer
	instead of looking up gate by name for each send()
