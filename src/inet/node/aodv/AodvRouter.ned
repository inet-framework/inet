// It models a ~WirelessHost extended with ~Aodv submodule.
//
// AODV is an on-demand MANET routing protocol. Each node
// works similar to a 'router': they manage their own routing
// tables, send request for routes and consult the IP layer via
// Netfilter hooks for data forwarding.
//
// Scenerios where AODV routing is desired use this module as a
// host module.
//
// For more info about Aodv, see the corresponding module:
// ~Aodv and its C++ implementation with the same name.
//
// The AODV v.2 (known as Dymo) is also implemented: ~Dymo,
// ~DymoRouter.
