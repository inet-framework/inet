	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2013-11-13  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	EtherSwitch: L2NodeConfigurator is not needed in STP-unaware switch.

2013-11-07  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	EtherSwitch: spanningTreeProtocolVersion -> spanningTreeProtocol. - By
	default the switch is STP/RSTP unaware. - relayUnit implements
	IMACRelayUnit. - organized imports

2013-10-30  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	L2NetworkConfigurator, STP/RSTP: removed obsolete switches and examples.

2013-10-28  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	EtherSwitch, IEEE8021DRelay: changed to work with scenarios without STP.

2013-10-24  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	EtherSwitch: EtherSwitch now supports Spanning Tree algorithm.

	ISpanningTree: moduleinterface added to supports different versions of
	Spanning Tree protocols.

	SpanningTree: module renamed to "STP", this abbreviation refer to the
	protocol described in IEEE 802.1D-1998.

2013-10-17  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	STP: Spanning Tree Protocol added to INET.

2013-09-18  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	Switch:

	MACAddressTable:

	- MACAddressTable now has removeAgedEntriesIfNeeded() for efficient MAC
	 table purge.
	- Added clearTable() for lifecycle.

	MACRelayUnit: Added a simplified MACRelayUnit. It was necessary because
	MAC address table management has been separated from MACRelayUnitBase
	module.

	IMACRelayUnit: This moduleinterface changed to work with MACRelayUnit.
	There are no need for MAC address table configuration parameters anymore.

	EtherSwitch: Added MACAddressTable.

	Examples: ethernet/lans/largeNet example changed to work with the new
	RelayUnit.

	MACAddressTableAccess: MACAddressTable access name changed to macTable.

2013-11-07  Benjamin Seregi

	EtherSwitch: added both STP and RSTP protocols. These protocols
	are optional features of an EtherSwitch. The spanningTreeProtocol
	parameter specifies which protocol will be used. The default value
	of spanningTreeProtocol is an empty string indicating that the
	switch is STP/RSTP unaware.

	IEEE8021DRelay: The default relayUnit was replaced with IEEE8021DRelay.
	It is intended for supporting STP/RSTP port roles and states. In STP/RSTP
	unaware cases, however, its behavior was not changed.

2013-08-22  ------ inet-2.2.0 released ------

2013-06-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherSwitch: made eth[] modules replaceable

2013-06-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherSwitch: replaced EtherMAC with EthernetInterface so that
	external queues can be used (useful for e.g. QoS)

2013-06-17  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherSwitch: added lifecycle support

2013-06-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherHost: added NodeStatus, required by lifecycle operations

2013-03-21  Levente Meszaros

	EtherSwitch: renamed mac[] submodule vector to eth[]

2013-03-21  Levente Meszaros

	EtherSwitch: added InterfaceTable unconditionally; also added
	NotificationBoard, required by InterfaceTable.

2013-01-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherHost2: encap module made replaceable ("like IEtherEncap")

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-04-26  Tamas Borbely

	EtherHost,EtherHost2: EtherQoSQueue used as external queue.
	EtherQosQueue contains two queues: one for PAUSE frames,
	and one for data frames. The 'queueType' parameter specifies
	the type of the latter.

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-01-14  Andras Varga

	Added EtherLink.ned with various predefined Ethernet link types:
	Eth10M, Eth100M, Eth1G, Eth10G, Eth40G, Eth100G

2011-12-08  Andras Varga

	EtherHost: comment editing; reordering of submodules and connections
	for readability

2011-08-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherHost/EtherHost2 fix: display string contained "q=queue" instead of
	"q=txQueue" (EtherMAC internal queue object is called "txQueue")

2011-08-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherHost: use queueType="" instead of queueType="NoQueue" to select
	the internal queue of EtherMAC

2011-12-06  Andras Varga

	Added EtherHost2 that uses EtherEncap (EtherHost uses EtherLLC).

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	parameter rename: csmacdSupported -> csmacdSupport

2011-04-28  Rudolf Hornig

	EtherHost now defaults to internal queue implementation.

2011-04-27  Rudolf Hornig

	Ethernet refactoring. EtherHostQ removed. csmacdSupport parameter added
	to Switch, EtherHost and EthernetInterface.

2011-03-29  Zoltan Bojthe

	featuresupport: add ETHERNET feature

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Interfaces renamed to start with I.

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Module interface renaming.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2010-06-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherMAC, EtherMacFullDuplex use IEtherMAC moduleinterface

2010-06-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	Rename modules

	EtherMAC2 to EtherMACFullDuplex, EtherHost2 to EtherHostFullDuplex

2010-06-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	Add EtherHostQ and EtherHost2Q NED files

2009-07-21  Andras Varga

	labels change: EtherFrame/PPPFrame labels on hosts/routers renamed to
	EtherFrame-conn/PPPFrame-conn, so that EtherMAC, PPPInterface etc are
	not offered by the palette when editing a network

2009-07-19  Andras Varga

	added further module @labels (ethernet-node, wireless-node, mpls-node);
	added default icons to several module types

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	more gate labels added; also, fixed case of TCPOut gates (i.e. they got
	renamed to tcpOut)

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	added @labels(node) to hosts/routers so that they appear at top of the
	palette when editing a network (in OMNeT++ 4.1+)

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2008-05-29  Andras Varga

	Moved Ethernet switch and host to nodes/ethernet:
	- EtherSwitch.ned was under networkinterfaces/etherswitch
	- EtherHost was under examples/ethernet/lans

	If you are interested in the early history of the code,
	change to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- NetworkInterfaces/EtherSwitch INET/src/networkinterfaces/etherswitch
