2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	support

2013-03-21  Levente Meszaros

2011-07-20  Levente Meszaros

	Renamed uppergateIn to upperLayerIn and uppergateOut to upperLayerOut.

2011-07-19  Levente Meszaros

	src/battery

	ScenarioManager: src/world -> src/world/scenario

	IManetRouting: src/base/manetrouting -> src/networklayer

2011-04-27  Rudolf Hornig

	INET now compiles with MANET turnened off.

2011-04-20  Rudolf Hornig

	Initial takeover of MANET routing protocols from INETMANET.

2011-04-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Turned several modules optional: transport level protocols, relayUnit,
	mobility, Hook modules in NetworkLayer are created ONLY if they are
	really needed. StandardHost and Router have common link and networ layer
	(BaseHost). Wireless and AdhocHost is derive from StandardHost. Removed
	MobileHost (it is now AdhocHost), FailedRouter (was not used and trivial
	to implement), BurstHost moved to examples dir (too specific).

2011-04-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Added support for optional submodules in AccessPoint and in
	Ieee80211Nic.

2011-04-08  Rudolf Hornig

	the mgmtType parameter can be used to configure the NIC.

2011-04-07  Rudolf Hornig

	Fix for MacRelayUnit. Now correctly broadcasts the packets on all
	wireless interfaces.

	files

2011-03-29  Zoltan Bojthe

	featuresupport: add ETHERNET feature

	Obsolete parameters in NED files

2011-02-23  Zoltan Bojthe

	StandardHost* : enable differ udp, tcp, sctp Application Types in one
	Host

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2009-07-21  Andras Varga

	labels change: EtherFrame/PPPFrame labels on hosts/routers renamed to
	EtherFrame-conn/PPPFrame-conn, so that EtherMAC, PPPInterface etc are
	not offered by the palette when editing a network

2009-07-19  Andras Varga

	added further module @labels (ethernet-node, wireless-node, mpls-node);
	added default icons to several module types

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	more gate labels added; also, fixed case of TCPOut gates (i.e. they got
	renamed to tcpOut)

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	added @labels(node) to hosts/routers so that they appear at top of the
	palette when editing a network (in OMNeT++ 4.1+)

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2006-09-03  Andras Varga

	Initial version. [commit is marked as tuexen due to svn client misconfiguration]

	If you are interested in the early history of the code, change
	to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- INET/src/nodes/wireless Nodes/Wireless
