	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	Backport: mobility

	fingerprints of MoBAN mobility are changed

	backported registerProtocol

	make StandardHost6 more similar to StandardHost by adding hasTcp, hasUdp
	and hasSctp parameters (by Ingmar Baumgart)

	Follow the factoring of a loopback interface module from IPv4/IPv6:
	added LoopbackInterface to NodeBase6

	- renamed netwIn, netwOut gates to upperLayerIn, upperLayerOut

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-01-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added IPingApp interface and support for more than one PingApp in a host.

2011-07-21  Levente Meszaros

	Removed mgmtType from IWirelessNic and from implementors.
	There is no need to set this parameter in the subclasses, because it is
	the default in Ieee80211Nic.

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-04-15  Rudolf Hornig

	StandardHost6 and Router6 now have a common base (containing Link~ and
	NetworkLayer).

	Several modules - especially inside StandardHost6 - are now conditional
	(using NED's new "conditional submodule" feature), and will be instantiated
	only if needed. For example, TCP is only instantiated if there are TCP
	applications configured for the host.

	Router and StandardHost have optional mobility support. The mobility module
	is created only if there are wireless cards present in the node (numRadios>0).

	IExtInterface renamed to IExternalNic for naming consistency.

	Changed StandardHost6 and Router6 to use *.typename for ppp,eth,wlan
	interfaces and mobility type. "type-name" is replaced with "typename" in
	all INI and NED file (OMNeT++ change)

	Removed empty.xml files. Renamed routingTableFile to routingTable. Added
	default value to the parameter.

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Interfaces renamed to start with I. Renamed INetworkInterface to
	IWiredNic. Support for full duplex ethernet NIC.

2010-11-24  Rudolf Hornig

	Rewritten StandardHost6 to support multiple wireless cards, ext
	interface and SCTP protocol. NetworkLayer contains hook modules now that
	can be used to add filtering/measurement behavior between the interfaces
	and the network layer.

	StandardHost6: enable different udp, tcp, sctp application types in one
	host

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2009-07-21  Andras Varga

	labels change: EtherFrame/PPPFrame labels on hosts/routers renamed to
	EtherFrame-conn/PPPFrame-conn, so that EtherMAC, PPPInterface etc are
	not offered by the palette when editing a network

2009-07-19  Andras Varga

	added further module @labels (ethernet-node, wireless-node, mpls-node);
	added default icons to several module types

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	more gate labels added; also, fixed case of TCPOut gates (i.e. they got
	renamed to tcpOut)

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	added @labels(node) to hosts/routers so that they appear at top of the
	palette when editing a network (in OMNeT++ 4.1+)

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	gates, @unit, etc.)
