	Nodes in the network should be tagged with the @networkNode property
	because the previous @node property name was too generic.
	Also the INode marker interface in NED was renamed to INetworkNode.

2015-05-13  ------ inet-2.99.1 released ------

2015-04-16  Rudolf Hornig

	Added INode module interface so simulation may use this interface to create
	networks with node types configurable from ini files.

2015-03-16  Levente Meszaros

	Fixed PIM issues when all features are turned off. Added IPIMRouting and
	merged MulticastRouter parameters into Router.

2015-01-28  Irene Ruengeler

	Implemented a virtual TUN interface.

2015-04-16  Rudolf Hornig

	NodeBase implements the INode interface. As all "node type" modules
	implement this module interface it is now possible to create networks
	(using the <"actualNodeType"> like INode construct) where the actual node
	type can be configured from an ini file.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-24  Andras Varga

	added PcapRecorder (ZBojthe):
	  pcapRecorder[] submodule array added to NodeBase (to ease instantiation in hosts/routers)

2011-04-08  Rudolf Hornig

	StandardHost and Router now have a common base (NodeBase - containing Link~ and
	NetworkLayer) Wireless~ and AdhocHost is derived from StandardHost. All of
	them (including Router) support multiple wireless, Ethernet, PPP and
	external interfaces (i.e. multiple wireless radios are supported using
	different channels)

	Several modules - especially inside StandardHost - are now conditional
	(using NED's new "conditional submodule" feature), and will be instantiated
	only if needed. For example, TCP is only instantiated if there are TCP
	applications configured for the host.

	Router and StandardHost have optional mobility support. The mobility module
	is created only if there are wireless cards present in the node (numRadios>0).
	Of course WirelessHost and AdhocHost have mobility by default. You can configure
	the mobility type using the "mobilityType" parameter. BasicMobility have
	been renamed to NullMobility (resulting stationary nodes). There is a dummy
	mobility type called NoMobility which does not have any C++ implementation.
	Nodes that do not need mobility support (i.e. no radios) should set their type
	to NoMobility.

	changed StandardHost and Router to use *.typename for ppp,eth,wlan
	interfaces and mobility type

	Refactored in Ethernet and PPP interfaces. NoQueue can be used also as
	queueType parameter. Added support for input and output hooks in NICs.

	IExtInterface renamed to IExternalNic for naming consistency.

	Removed different Ieee802.11 wireless NICs. Only Ieee80211 remained and
	the mgmtType parameter can be used to configure the NIC.

	FailedRouter has been removed (was a trivial node). BurstHost moved to the
	example directory (it was not generic and was used only by a single example).
	MobileHost has been removed; use AdhocHost instead as a drop-in replacement.

2011-03-10  Rudolf Hornig

	Moved NAMTrace and NAMTraceWriter to the obsolete directory.

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Interfaces renamed to start with I. Renamed INetworkInterface to
	IWiredNic. Support for full duplex ethernet NIC.

2010-11-22  Rudolf Hornig

	Added plugin interfaces to the network layer to be able to add
	drop/duplicate modules, througput meters etc.

2010-11-22  Rudolf Hornig

	EtherMAC interface introduced and a more configurable StandardHost

2011-02-23  Zoltan Bojthe

	StandardHost: enable different udp, tcp, sctp Application Types in one
	Host

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added module @labels (ethernet-node, wireless-node, mpls-node);
	added default icons to several module types
	added @labels(node) to hosts/routers so that they appear at top of the
	palette when editing a network (in OMNeT++ 4.1+)

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)
