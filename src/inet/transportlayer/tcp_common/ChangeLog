2015-04-16  Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored and cleaned up TCP header options.

2015-04-14  Andras Varga

	Fixed TCPSegment parsimPack/unpack for OMNeT++ 4.6

2015-03-18  Levente Meszaros

	Transport: Added ITransportPacket interface to TCPSegment, UDPPacket, and
	SCTPMessage. This change allows generic handling of transport packets. For
	example, see TunLoopbackApp.

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-12-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	NEDDOC fixes

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all INET classes.
	See base/ChangeLog for details.

2011-07-24  Andras Varga

	cosmetics

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

	TCP SACK ASSERT fix by Thomas Reschka

	The patch is fixing the issue which is described here:
	http://groups.google.com/group/omnetpp/browse_thread/thread/c39c2a55db10fc7d/1a6e05230c54ac7b?lnk=gst&q=TCP+SACK#1a6e05230c54ac7b

	In addition it avoids an ASSERT in setSackedBit() which appears when an
	ACK (with SACK option) is received and AckNo & SACK are below snd_una
	(this is no D-SACK case).

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe
