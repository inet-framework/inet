TCP_lwip
=======

This directory contains an LWIP version of TCP called TCP_lwip.
This TCP stack based on lwip 1.3.2 version.
This TCP stack work on IPV4 and IPV6, too.
This base algorithm can be extended and customized via "queue"
classes that implement the TcpLwipSendQueue and TcpLwipReceiveQueue
classes in bytecount and object mode, and are selected via TCP application's NED parameters.

The main class is TCP_lwip.

Note that it is possible to use different TCP implementations at the same time
in a simulation, for example you can have some hosts in your simulation
with TCP_lwip and others witch with TCP modules. Use the tcpType parameter
in StandardHost to change the TCP implementation.
