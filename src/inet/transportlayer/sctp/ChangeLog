	Bugfix for SCTPAssociation::process_RCV_Message(): After

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)

	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	SCTP: getAddressLevel optimalization: call only once

2012-01-18  Andras Varga

	getAddressLevel() moved from common.cc to the SCTP code

	That was its only usage; "address level" as a concept doesn't appear to
	be universally useful.

2012-01-18  Andras Varga

	common: getLevel() --> getAddressLevel(); refinements on categorization

	IPv4: BROADCAST should probably be on level 0 per analogy with IPv6;
	IETF, TEST_NET, RESERVED are unused or special-purpose, probably better
	on level 0 as well.

	change opp_error to throw cRuntimeError

2011-01-03  Alberto Cortes

	Fix SCTP Path.Max.Retrans threshold

	RFC4960 section 8.2, second paragraph, says:

	   When the value in the error counter exceeds the protocol parameter
	  'Path.Max.Retrans' of that destination address, the endpoint should
	  mark the destination transport address as inactive, and a
	  notification SHOULD be sent to the upper layer.

	But old code marks the address as inactive when the error counter is
	*equal* to Path.Max.Retrans instead of when it *exceeds* it. This bug
	leads to make premature handovers (about half the time of what it should
	be, due to the exponential grow of the RTO between retransmissions).

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	using getEncapsulatedPacket() instead deprecated getEncapsulatedMsg()

2010-10-18  Alberto Cortés

	Add scalars & vectors to SCTP for HBs & HB-ACKs

	4 new scalars keep track of the number of Heartbeats and Heartbeat-ACKs
	sent and received on each path. The vectors hold the time when they were
	sent or received.

2010-12-06  Rudolf Hornig

	Reverting previous commit.

2010-10-29  Rudolf Hornig

	Added some addinitinal statistics to SCTP

	Change some castings to check_and_cast

2010-10-07  Alberto Cortés

	Add "sent TSN" vector recording to SCTP

	SCTP already defines the vector pathTSN for recording the sent TSNs, but
	it was never used. This patch makes SCTP do the actual recording.

	[reported by Thomas Gamer]

2010-03-12  Rudolf Hornig
