C++ quirks (to be worked on when SCTP-2.2 is integrated from "master" branch):

- "typedef struct {...} Foo" is a C trick, typedef is not needed in C++

- "inline" keyword unnecessary when the function is defined inside the class declaration (it'll be inline anyway -- or not if the compiler decides so)

- "return (expr)" -- parens not needed

- "const int32" as function argument -- "const" is not very useful here (value cannot be changed by the caller anyway) and certainly not customary, could be removed

- data members of TimeStats start with uppercase

- message files: use "packet" keyword instead of "message Foo extends cPacket"

- cPolymorphic -> cObject
