/**
 * UdpSocket is a convenience class, to make it easier to send and receive
 * UDP packets from your application models. You'd have one (or more)
 * UdpSocket object(s) in your application simple module class, and call
 * its member functions (bind(), connect(), sendTo(), etc.) to create and
 * configure a socket, and to send datagrams.
 *
 * UdpSocket chooses and remembers the socketId for you, assembles and sends command
 * packets such as UDP_C_BIND to UDP, and can also help you deal with packets and
 * notification messages arriving from UDP.
 *
 * Here is a code fragment that creates an UDP socket and sends a 1K packet
 * over it (the code can be placed in your handleMessage() or activity()):
 *
 * <pre>
 *   UdpSocket socket;
 *   socket.setOutputGate(gate("udpOut"));
 *   socket.connect(Address("10.0.0.2"), 2000);
 *
 *   cPacket *pk = new cPacket("dgram");
 *   pk->setByteLength(1024);
 *   socket.send(pk);
 *
 *   socket.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Processing messages sent up by the UDP module is relatively straightforward.
 * You only need to distinguish between data packets and error notifications,
 * by checking the message kind (should be either UDP_I_DATA or UDP_I_ERROR),
 * and casting the control info to UDPDataIndication or UdpErrorIndication.
 * USPSocket provides some help for this with the belongsToSocket() and
 * belongsToAnyUDPSocket() methods.
