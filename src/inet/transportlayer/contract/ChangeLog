2013-08-22  ------ inet-2.2.0 released ------

2013-07-25  Tamas Borbely

	UDP: implemented ReuseAddress option (it's like SO_REUSEADDR socket
	option in Linux)

	If ReuseAddress is set to true on two sockets, then they can bind to the
	same local address/port.

	E.g. the following works:

	      UDPSocket s1, s1;
	     ...
	     s1.setReuseAddress(true);
	     s1.bind(7777);
	     s2.setReuseAddress(true);
	     s2.bind(IPv4Address("10.0.0.1"), 7777);

	s2 will receive packets whose destination address is 10.0.0.1, s1 will
	receive all other packets

	sctp: Added 8 new strategies for stream scheduling
	- new SCTP_C_SET_STREAM_PRIO code in SctpCommandCode

2013-07-17  Irene Ruengeler

	sctp: Implemented SCTP Stream Reset (RFC 6525)
	- new SCTP_C_STREAM_RESET code in SctpCommandCode
	- new SCTP_I_SEND_STREAMS_RESETTED, SCTP_I_RCV_STREAMS_RESETTED,
	  SCTP_I_RESET_REQUEST_FAILED code in SctpStatusInd
	- SCTPSocket's listen, connect, conectx now have a streamReset parameter

2013-07-10  Irene Ruengeler

	- SCTPSocket::connect and SCTPSocket::connectx has an additional
	  Partial Reliability related parameter
	- SCTPSocket's CallbackInterface has a new method: msgAbandonedArrived(int assocId)

2013-07-02  Irene Ruengeler

	UDPSocket: removed callback support

	It didn't provide much utility value, and apparently nobody used it.

2011-07-25  Andras Varga

	Heavy API changes; added multicast, broadcast and ttl support

	Features/improvements:
	- added support for the following socket options (see Unix setsockopt()):
	  time-to-live (unicast and multicast), broadcast, multicast output
	  interface, join multicast group, leave multicast group.

	- UDPControlInfo was as a bit confusing, as it contained the union of
	  all fields needed for all commands/indications, so it was not
	  clear whether some field X was used for some command/indication,
	  and if so, what its exact role was. Specific UDPControlInfo classes
	  are now much more explicit about this.

	- UDPSocket class now contains much less state (clearer responsibilities,
	  less chance of disagreement with UDP module's view)

	Details:
	- UDPControlInfo has been split to: UDPBindCommand, UDPConnectCommand,
	  UDPSendCommand, UDPCloseCommand, and UDPDataIndication,
	  UDPErrorIndication for the opposite direction. Used with the
	  corresponding UDP_C_xxx and UDP_I_xxx message kinds.

	- UDP_C_UNBIND message kind has been renamed to UDP_C_CLOSE

	- added UDP_C_SETOPTION (for setting socket options);
	  it must be acompanied by any of: UDPSetTimeToLiveCommand,
	  UDPSetBroadcastCommand, UDPSetMulticastInterfaceCommand,
	  UDPJoinMulticastGroupCommand, UDPLeaveMulticastGroupCommand.

	- the "unspecified" port number value has been changed from 0 to -1,
	  for consistency with other parameters in the NED file

	- userId was removed, as it hasn't offered a tremendous utility
	  value, and apparently nobody used it

	UDPSocket class:
	- now it stores minimal state (practically just the socket id),
	  and everything else is immediately sent down to the UDP module
	- new methods for socket options:
	     setTimeToLive(),
	     setBroadcast(),
	     setMulticastOutputInterface()
	     joinMulticastGroup()
	     leaveMulticastGroup()
	- new utility method:
	     getReceivedPacketInfo()
	- removed methods:
	     setUserId() / getUserId() -- userId is no longer;
	     getState() / stateName() -- state is not kept;
	     getLocalAddress() / getLocalPort() -- state is not kept;
	     setMulticastInterfaceId() / getMulticastInterfaceId() -- renamed

2011-07-21  Andras Varga

	UDP, UDPSocket: documentation updated. Apparently the UDPSocket docu
	was a copy/paste of TCPSocket docu.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	UDPSocket: send() and sendTo() to accept cPackets only.
	Note: in UDP, cMessage with UDP_C_DATA would cause "cannot cast" anyway.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-08-04  Andras Varga

	Initial checkin, into transport/contract/.

	If you are interested in the early history of the code, change
