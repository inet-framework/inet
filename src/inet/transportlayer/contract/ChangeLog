2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Directory restructuring (Rudolf Hornig):
	- contents split up to sctp/, tcp/, udp/ subdirectories

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

2014-01-22  Levente Meszaros

	Moved TCP, UDP and SCTP contracts into separate directories.

2013-07-25  Tamas Borbely

	UDP: implemented ReuseAddress option (it's like SO_REUSEADDR socket
	option in Linux)

	If ReuseAddress is set to true on two sockets, then they can bind to the
	same local address/port.

	E.g. the following works:

	      UDPSocket s1, s1;
	     ...
	     s1.setReuseAddress(true);
	     s1.bind(7777);
	     s2.setReuseAddress(true);
	     s2.bind(IPv4Address("10.0.0.1"), 7777);

	s2 will receive packets whose destination address is 10.0.0.1, s1 will
	receive all other packets

2013-07-17  Irene Ruengeler

	  Partial Reliability related parameter

	UDPSocket: removed callback support

	It didn't provide much utility value, and apparently nobody used it.

2011-07-25  Andras Varga

	Heavy API changes; added multicast, broadcast and ttl support

	Features/improvements:
	- added support for the following socket options (see Unix setsockopt()):
	  time-to-live (unicast and multicast), broadcast, multicast output
	  interface, join multicast group, leave multicast group.

	- UDPControlInfo was as a bit confusing, as it contained the union of
	  all fields needed for all commands/indications, so it was not
	  clear whether some field X was used for some command/indication,
	  and if so, what its exact role was. Specific UDPControlInfo classes
	  are now much more explicit about this.

	- UDPSocket class now contains much less state (clearer responsibilities,
	  less chance of disagreement with UDP module's view)

	Details:
	- UDPControlInfo has been split to: UDPBindCommand, UDPConnectCommand,
	  UDPSendCommand, UDPCloseCommand, and UDPDataIndication,
	  UDPErrorIndication for the opposite direction. Used with the
	  corresponding UDP_C_xxx and UDP_I_xxx message kinds.

	- UDP_C_UNBIND message kind has been renamed to UDP_C_CLOSE

	- added UDP_C_SETOPTION (for setting socket options);
	  it must be acompanied by any of: UDPSetTimeToLiveCommand,
	  UDPSetBroadcastCommand, UDPSetMulticastInterfaceCommand,
	  UDPJoinMulticastGroupCommand, UDPLeaveMulticastGroupCommand.

	- the "unspecified" port number value has been changed from 0 to -1,
	  for consistency with other parameters in the NED file

	- userId was removed, as it hasn't offered a tremendous utility
	  value, and apparently nobody used it

	UDPSocket class:
	- now it stores minimal state (practically just the socket id),
	  and everything else is immediately sent down to the UDP module
	- new methods for socket options:
	     setTimeToLive(),
	     setBroadcast(),
	     setMulticastOutputInterface()
	     joinMulticastGroup()
	     leaveMulticastGroup()
	- new utility method:
	     getReceivedPacketInfo()
	- removed methods:
	     setUserId() / getUserId() -- userId is no longer;
	     getState() / stateName() -- state is not kept;
	     getLocalAddress() / getLocalPort() -- state is not kept;
	     setMulticastInterfaceId() / getMulticastInterfaceId() -- renamed

2011-07-21  Andras Varga

	UDP, UDPSocket: documentation updated. Apparently the UDPSocket docu
	was a copy/paste of TCPSocket docu.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	UDPSocket: send() and sendTo() to accept cPackets only.
	Note: in UDP, cMessage with UDP_C_DATA would cause "cannot cast" anyway.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks
