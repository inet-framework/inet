/**
 * TcpSocket is a convenience class, to make it easier to manage TCP connections
 * from your application models. You'd have one (or more) TcpSocket object(s)
 * in your application simple module class, and call its member functions
 * (bind(), listen(), connect(), etc.) to open, close or abort a TCP connection.
 *
 * TcpSocket chooses and remembers the connId for you, assembles and sends command
 * packets (such as OPEN_ACTIVE, OPEN_PASSIVE, CLOSE, ABORT, etc.) to TCP,
 * and can also help you deal with packets and notification messages arriving
 * from TCP.
 *
 * A session which opens a connection from local port 1000 to 10.0.0.2:2000,
 * sends 16K of data and closes the connection may be as simple as this
 * (the code can be placed in your handleMessage() or activity()):
 *
 * <pre>
 *   TcpSocket socket;
 *   socket.connect(Address("10.0.0.2"), 2000);
 *
 *   Packet *packet = new Packet("data", makeShared<ByteCountChunk>(B(16*1024)));
 *   socket.send(packet);
 *
 *   socket.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Dealing with packets and notification messages coming from TCP is somewhat
 * more cumbersome. Basically you have two choices: you either process those
 * messages yourself, or let TcpSocket do part of the job. For the latter, you
 * give TcpSocket a callback object of the type TcpSocket::ICallback, on which
 * it will invoke the appropriate member functions: socketEstablished(),
 * socketDataArrived(), socketFailure(), socketPeerClosed(), etc. The callback
 * object can be your simple module class too.
 *
 * Note that receiving data (i.e. callbacks to socketDataArrived()) are subject
 * to the read mode. Namely, the socket can be in one of two modes: "autoread"
 * and "explicit-read". In "autoread" mode, TCP immediately forwards received
 * data to the app, while in "explicit-read" mode, the app must issue explicit
 * READ commands. The latter can be done with the read() member function. The
 * socket is created in "autoread" mode by default; "explicit-read" mode can be
 * selected by calling setAutoRead(false) before the connection is established.
 * Note that sockets created by forking off a listening socket inherit the mode
 * from the listening socket.
 *
 * Note that data arrive piecewise; the BufferingCallback utility class
 * is provided to simplify the job of assembling the data into a single message.
 *
 * This code skeleton example shows how to set up a TcpSocket to use the module
 * itself as callback object:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class MyModule : public cSimpleModule, public TcpSocket::ICallback
 * {
 *     TcpSocket socket;
 *     virtual void socketDataArrived(TcpSocket *tcpSocket, Packet *packet, bool urgent);
 *     virtual void socketFailure(int connId, int code);
 *     ...
 * };
 *
 * void MyModule::initialize() {
 *     socket.setCallback(this);
 * }
 *
 * void MyModule::handleMessage(cMessage *msg) {
 *     if (socket.belongsToSocket(msg))
 *         socket.processMessage(msg); // dispatch to socketXXX() methods
 *     else
 *         ...
 * }
 *
 * void MyModule::socketDataArrived(TcpSocket *tcpSocket, Packet *packet, bool) {
 *     EV << "Received TCP data, " << packet->getByteLength() << " bytes\\n";
 *     delete packet;
 * }
 *
 * void MyModule::socketFailure(TcpSocket *tcpSocket, int code) {
 *     if (code==TCP_I_CONNECTION_RESET)
 *         EV << "Connection reset!\\n";
 *     else if (code==TCP_I_CONNECTION_REFUSED)
 *         EV << "Connection refused!\\n";
 *     else if (code==TCP_I_TIMEOUT)
 *         EV << "Connection timed out!\\n";
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If you need to manage a large number of sockets (e.g. in a server
 * application which handles multiple incoming connections), the SocketMap
 * class may be useful. The following code fragment could be used to handle
 * incoming connections:
 *
 * <pre>
 * TcpSocket *socket = check_and_cast_nullable<TcpSocket*>socketMap.findSocketFor(msg);
 * if (!socket) {
 *     // not yet in socketMap, must be new incoming connection: add to socketMap
 *     socket = new TcpSocket(msg);
 *     socket->setOutputGate(gate("tcpOut"));
 *     socket->setCallback(this);
 *     socketMap.addSocket(socket);
 * }
 *
 * // dispatch to socketEstablished(), socketDataArrived(), socketPeerClosed()
 * // or socketFailure()
 * socket->processMessage(msg);
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see SocketMap
