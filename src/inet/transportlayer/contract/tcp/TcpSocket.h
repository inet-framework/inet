/**
 * TcpSocket is a convenience class, to make it easier to manage TCP connections
 * from your application models. You'd have one (or more) TcpSocket object(s)
 * in your application simple module class, and call its member functions
 * (bind(), listen(), connect(), etc.) to open, close or abort a TCP connection.
 *
 * TcpSocket chooses and remembers the connId for you, assembles and sends command
 * packets (such as OPEN_ACTIVE, OPEN_PASSIVE, CLOSE, ABORT, etc.) to TCP,
 * and can also help you deal with packets and notification messages arriving
 * from TCP.
 *
 * A session which opens a connection from local port 1000 to 10.0.0.2:2000,
 * sends 16K of data and closes the connection may be as simple as this
 * (the code can be placed in your handleMessage() or activity()):
 *
 * <pre>
 *   TcpSocket socket;
 *   socket.connect(Address("10.0.0.2"), 2000);
 *
 *   msg = new cMessage("data1");
 *   msg->setByteLength(16*1024);  // 16K
 *   socket.send(msg);
 *
 *   socket.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * Dealing with packets and notification messages coming from TCP is somewhat
 * more cumbersome. Basically you have two choices: you either process those
 * messages yourself, or let TcpSocket do part of the job. For the latter,
 * you give TcpSocket a callback object on which it'll invoke the appropriate
 * member functions: socketEstablished(), socketDataArrived(), socketFailure(),
 * socketPeerClosed(), etc (these are methods of TcpSocket::ICallback).,
 * The callback object can be your simple module class too.
 *
 * This code skeleton example shows how to set up a TcpSocket to use the module
 * itself as callback object:
 *
 * <pre>
 * class MyModule : public cSimpleModule, public TcpSocket::ICallback
 * {
 *     TcpSocket socket;
 *     virtual void socketDataArrived(TcpSocket *tcpSocket, cPacket *msg, bool urgent);
 *     virtual void socketFailure(int connId, int code);
 *     ...
 * };
 *
 * void MyModule::initialize() {
 *     socket.setCallback(this);
 * }
 *
 * void MyModule::handleMessage(cMessage *msg) {
 *     if (socket.belongsToSocket(msg))
 *         socket.processMessage(msg); // dispatch to socketXXXX() methods
 *     else
 *         ...
 * }
 *
 * void MyModule::socketDataArrived(TcpSocket *tcpSocket, cPacket *msg, bool) {
 *     EV << "Received TCP data, " << msg->getByteLength() << " bytes\\n";
 *     delete msg;
 * }
 *
 * void MyModule::socketFailure(TcpSocket *tcpSocket, int code) {
 *     if (code==TCP_I_CONNECTION_RESET)
 *         EV << "Connection reset!\\n";
 *     else if (code==TCP_I_CONNECTION_REFUSED)
 *         EV << "Connection refused!\\n";
 *     else if (code==TCP_I_TIMEOUT)
 *         EV << "Connection timed out!\\n";
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If you need to manage a large number of sockets (e.g. in a server
 * application which handles multiple incoming connections), the SocketMap
 * class may be useful. The following code fragment to handle incoming
 * connections is from the Ldp module:
 *
 * <pre>
 * TcpSocket *socket = check_and_cast_nullable<TcpSocket*>socketMap.findSocketFor(msg);
 * if (!socket)
 * {
 *     // not yet in socketMap, must be new incoming connection: add to socketMap
 *     socket = new TcpSocket(msg);
 *     socket->setOutputGate(gate("tcpOut"));
 *     socket->setCallback(this);
 *     socketMap.addSocket(socket);
 * }
 * // dispatch to socketEstablished(), socketDataArrived(), socketPeerClosed()
 * // or socketFailure()
 * socket->processMessage(msg);
 * </pre>
 *
 * @see TcpSocketMap
