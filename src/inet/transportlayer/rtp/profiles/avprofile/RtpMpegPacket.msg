// An ~RtpMpegPacket is intended to be capsulated into an ~RtpPacket when
// transmitting mpeg data with rtp under the rtp audio/video profile.
// It stores information about the mpeg data as described in rfc 2250.
// This implementation doesn't transport real mpeg data. It is intended
// to simulate storing mpeg data by adding length.
// Currently only one header field (picture type) is filled with the right
// value. The values for the other header fields can't be determined by
// reading the gdf file.
