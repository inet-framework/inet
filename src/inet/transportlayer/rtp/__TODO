Notes: 

Andras Varga, 2008 Jun:
    State: it compiles, runs, and does *something*, but crashes frequently

    Found suspicious things in the code, to be checked:
     - packet length bit/byte mismatch?
     - simtime_t plain cast to integer and assigned to packet fields (1s resolution)

    TODO:
     - replace cArray with std::vector everywhere
     - use msg files instead of lengthy manually coded classes
     - use controlInfo instead of InterfacePacket
     - RTPProfile and Server/Receiver probably don't need to be modules.
       It's quite enough if they are plain C++ classes that implement
       an interface, and get instantiated via cClassFactory::createOne()

    Patches welcome...

    Also: move RTPHost out under nodes/?

Ahmed Ayadi, 2007:
    RTP is now integrated on INET framework
    If RTP is important to you, please write.

This is the original todo list:
- rtp intermediate systems
- more profiles
- more data formats
- integration with RTSP model from Arndt Buschmann <a.buschmann@gmx.de>
  (new cvs module or both in one)
