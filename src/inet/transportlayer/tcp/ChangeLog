	TcpState, TcpEventCode, TcpStateVariables defined in MSG files.
	Moved TcpStateVariables to new TcpConnectionState.msg.

2022-02-23  Zoltan Bojthe

	TcpConnection: Removed unnecessary foreign declarations.
	TcpConnection: Added missing fields to MSG file.

2021-09-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed bug #92: TcpConnection: processSegment1stThru8th: accept simultaneous open.

2021-03-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	Changed if-else-if ladders in initialize() to separate if statements because
	different stages may have the same number.

	Updated all registerService, registerProtocol methods and calls.

2020-09-03  Andras Varga

2020-09-02  Andras Varga

	Renamed packet -> tcpSegment and tcpseg -> tcpHeader, for clarity.

2020-09-01  Andras Varga

	Removed code to withhold last, fractional segment if there's more data in
	the send buffer. See #558.

	I have not found an explicit statement about this in the RFCs. However, I
	found pcap traces of TCP file transfers (e.g. tcp-ethereal-file1.trace on
	https://wiki.wireshark.org/SampleCaptures), which contain several
	instances of a burst of full-size segments followed by a fractional one,
	which indicates that this change is probably right.

2020-08-31  Andras Varga

	Updating state->snd_max moved into sendSegment()

2020-08-28  Andras Varga

	Removed state->sentBytes, converted to retval of sendSegment().

	It was only used immediately after a sendSegment(), and contained the
	payload length in the segment just sent. This is better done with
	sendSegment()'s return value.

2020-08-25  Andras Varga

	Fixed #558: Nagle was not obeyed for data > MSS sent (credit: Marius Poke)

2020-06-04  Zoltan Bojthe

2019-09-30  Marcel Marek

	Added simplified version of TCP/IP ECN mechanism.

	The mechanism is activated by setting ecnEnabled = true in .ini file. It
	uses normal ECN-setup SYN and SYN-ACK  to establish a TCP flow. Sets
	ECT(0) only on non-ACK packets.

	Adds ECE and CWR flags to TCP header. Each packet marked with IP ECN CE
	is echoed back with TCP ECE set.
	(allowing multiple packets be echoed back within the same window).

2019-09-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	Changed base class to TransportProtocolBase.

2019-09-23  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added TCP socket options (TTL and TOS) -- note that tcp option is
	per-connection. Setting an option affects all segments exchanged in that
	connection.
	Removed AppConnKey.
	Reorganized TCP main class to better reflect the execution flow.

2019-09-16  Zoltan Bojthe

	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	TCP: queue size limitation

	- By default, the TCP behaviour remains unchanged.
	- If queue limit is set by the TCP_C_QUEUE_BYTES_LIMIT command,
	  the TCP model gives an indication to the application when it should
	  generate more data.

	This patch is helpful when comparing SCTP and TCP behaviour.

	TCP SACK ASSERT fix by Thomas Reschka

	The patch is fixing the issue which is described here:
	http://groups.google.com/group/omnetpp/browse_thread/thread/c39c2a55db10fc7d/1a6e05230c54ac7b?lnk=gst&q=TCP+SACK#1a6e05230c54ac7b

	In addition it avoids an ASSERT in setSackedBit() which appears when an
	ACK (with SACK option) is received and AckNo & SACK are below snd_una
	(this is no D-SACK case).

	* added check for received SACK below total cumulative ACK (=snd_una) in processSACKOption() to avoid ASSERT in setSackedBit().
	* updated TCP Option Numbers in TCPSegment.msg. Based on [http://www.iana.org/assignments/tcp-parameters/].

2011-06-04  Thomas Reschka

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-02-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	* added some improvements:
	- added TCPDataTransferMode
	      The sendQueueClass/rcvQueueClass parameters are gone. They were used to
	      select what to transmit inside TCP segments: C++ objects (cPacket) or byte
	      counts only. Now, this can (must) be specified per-connection by the app
	      layer, because the app knows best what it requires. Also, instead of two
	      class names now there is a single enum value; it should be put into the
	      dataTransferMode field of TCPOpenCommand. Potential values are:
	         TCP_TRANSFER_UNDEFINED = 0;  // Invalid value
	         TCP_TRANSFER_BYTECOUNT = 1;  // Transmit byte counts only
	         TCP_TRANSFER_OBJECT = 2;     // Transmit the application packet C++ objects
	         TCP_TRANSFER_BYTESTREAM = 3; // Transmit actual bytes
	- added new DataStreamSendQueue
	- added new moduleinterface ITCP
	- added new functions to compare, merge and slitt regions in TCPVirtualDataRcvQueue

	* added some optimizations:
	- added check for truncateSegment()
	- moved down truncateSegment() call
	- added ASSERT to sendSegmentDuringLossRecoveryPhase()
	- moved SACK-related functions from TCPConnectionUtil to a new file TCPConnectionSackUtil
	- changed event logging
	- changed code style to enhance code readability
	- renamed local variable from skip_sacks_array to dsack_inserted in addSacks()
	- optimised length calculation in sendSegment()
	- replaced 'opp_error' by 'throw cRuntimeError'
	- changed uint32 nextSeg() to bool nextSeg()
	- optimised setPipe(), nextSeg(), addSacks()

2011-01-31  Thomas Reschka

	* added some improvements and optimizations:
	- although not compliant with RFC 793, page 46: restored Zoltan Bojthe's modifications
	  in isSegmentAcceptable() to accept an ACK on end of window to fix bug #160
	- added check for "acceptable ack" in isSegmentAcceptable(). Based on [RFC 793, page 25]
	- added new rcvNASegVector ("rcvd naseg"): total number of received not acceptable segments
	- added ASSERT in addSacks() to avoid generation of SACKs with equal start and end sequence number
	- extended condition in processSegment1stThru8th() to avoid D-SACK generation at reception of ooo segments without payload
	- moved up truncateSegment() call
	- added ASSERT in truncateSegment()

2010-07-12  Thomas Reschka

	* fixed bug in retransmitData() - snd_nxt must stay at snd_una after RTO.

	* eliminated ASSERT in TCPConnection::retransmitData(); - by moving up receivedDataAck() in processSegment1stThru8th().

	* extended condition in processSegment1stThru8th() to allow calling processAckInEstabEtc() in LAST-ACK state.
	  If one of the last data segments is lost while already in LAST-ACK state (e.g. if using TCPEchoApps)
	  TCP must be able to process acceptable acknowledgments, however please note RFC 793, page 73:
	  "LAST-ACK STATE
	 The only thing that can arrive in this state is an
	 acknowledgment of our FIN.  If our FIN is now acknowledged,
	 delete the TCB, enter the CLOSED state, and return."

2010-07-04  Thomas Reschka

	* changed computation of Restart Window (RW) from RW = IW to RW = min(IW,cwnd). Based on [RFC 5681, page 11].

	* updated TCP Option Numbers in TCPSegment.msg. Based on [http://www.iana.org/assignments/tcp-parameters/].

2010-06-23  Zoltan Bojthe

	* added some optimizations and improvements:
	- optimized PAWS check
	- optimized ASSERT condition in convertSimtimeToTS() and convertTSToSimtime()
	- integrated scaleRcvWnd() into updateRcvWnd()
	- simplified setting window size
	- replaced use of '12' by constant TCP_OPTION_TS_SIZE in sendData(), setPipe() and nextSeg()
	- added event logging in isSegmentAcceptable()
	- renamed dataToSend() to isSendQueueEmpty(), optimized function body and adjusted its use in sendData()

2010-06-19  Thomas Reschka

	* implemented RFC 1323 (TCP Extensions for High Performance):
	- Window Scale option
	- Timestamps option (Round-Trip Time Measurement - RTTM)
	- Protect Against Wrapped Sequence Numbers (PAWS)
	- added a PAWS modification according to the latest proposal
	  of the tcplw@cray.com list (Braden 1993/04/26)

	* implemented missing part of RFC 2581: Re-starting Idle Connections

	* added some improvements:
	- added check for TS and SACK support in writeHeaderOptions() to avoide unnecessary NOPs
	- moved condition: if (rcvWndVector) rcvWndVector->record(state->rcv_wnd); into updateRcvWnd()
	- changed parts of SACK implementation to respect potential use of TS option
	- changed parts of updateWndInfo() to respect potential use of WS option
	- changed parts of the delayedAck algorithm

	* fixed 'TCP data transfer stopped before all bytes transmitted' issue. See bug #160

	* fixed some issues (not yet reported):
	- the node doing the passive open should use mss as cwnd! Calling receivedDataAck()
	  after receiving ACK for SYN,ACK changes cwnd to 2*mss!
	- a SACK supporting node should not include a SACK_PERMITTED option in his SYN,ACK
	  when the received SYN was without SACK_PERMITTED
	- calling readHeaderOptions() was missing in certain situations (receivedOutOfOrderSegment(),
	  receiveSeqChanged(), receivedAckForDataNotYetSent()) now readHeaderOptions() is called in:
	  1. processSegmentInListen()
	  2. processSegmentInSynSent()
	  3. processSegment1stThru8th() [NEW]
	- calling ackSent() was missing in sendSynAck() and sendRstAck()
	- added condition: (bytes + options_len <= snd_mss) in sendSegment()
	- added condition in processSACKOption() to check sack_enabled and current TCP state

	* added some TCP patches submitted by Zoltan Bojthe (see tcpfixes branch):
	- add a getBufferStartSeq() function to TCP queues
	- bugfix for DumbTCP
	- Eliminate ASSERT when resend last packet after sent a FIN
	- Move sequence number compare functions to TCPSegment.h
	- TCP fix: replace std::max() with seqGreater(), when comparing sequence numbers

2010-03-26  Andras Varga

	* fix: represent port numbers with ushort. Previously it was short
	at places, which caused problems for large port numbers due to sign
	extension [reported by Thomas Gamer]

2010-02-27  Andras Varga

	* added optionName() method

2010-02-26  Andras Varga

	* Broke up long function TCPConnection::readHeaderOptions()

	* minor refactoring to increase readability

2010-02-26  Andras Varga

	* fixed following issues with patch submitted by Thomas Reschka:
	- assertion in TCPConnectionUtil.cc line 1056 after reception of SYN duplicate. See bug #121
	- too early transition from ESTABLISHED to CLOSE_WAIT state
	  when FIN has been received but segments have been lost before. See bug #139
	- unnecessary delay before sending the last data segment if nagle is enabled

2010-02-16  Rudolf Hornig

	* fixed 'FIN does not get retransmitted' issue with patch submitted by Andras Varga and Thomas Reschka. See bug #123

2010-02-11  Rudolf Hornig

	* fixed assert issue in TCPVirtualDataSendQueue.cc line 60 with patch submitted by Thomas Reschka. See bug #122

2010-02-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	* fixed 'advertised window' issue

2010-02-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	* added checking value of advertisedWindow parameter

2009-11-27  Thomas Reschka

	* implemented TCPNewReno algorithm (RFC 3782):
	- the implementation is based on the 'default' algorithm specified in section 3 of RFC 3782.
	- algorithm variants (RFC 3782, sections 4-6) are NOT IMPLEMENTED.

2009-10-27  Rudolf Hornig

	* added ITCP module interface that is implemented by TCP and TCP_old

	* The old TCP (SACK-less) implementation is available as TCP_old

	* TCP (default) and TCP_old can be selected in StandardHost with the new tcpType parameter

2009-10-27  Thomas Reschka

	* implemented SACK TCP:
	  - the basic SACK implementation (RFC 2018 and RFC 2883)
	is located in TCP main (and not in flavours). This means that all existing
	TCP algorithm classes may be used with SACK, although currently only TCPReno
	makes sense.
	  - implemented (SACK)-based Loss Recovery algorithm (RFC 3517)
	which is a conservative replacement of the fast recovery algorithm (RFC 2581)
	integrated to TCPReno but not to TCPTahoe, TCPNoCongestionControl and DumbTCP.

	* implemented flow control:
	  - finite receive buffer size (initiated by parameter advertisedWindow).
	If receive buffer is exhausted (by out-of-order segments) and the
	payload length of a new received segment is higher than free receiver
	buffer, the new segment will be dropped. Such drops are recorded in
	tcpRcvQueueDropsVector.
	  - update receive window.
	The data receiver updates all receiver queue related variables before
	sending (ACK/SACK or DATA) and updates the receiver window,
	thus data receiver is able to advertise a zero window.
	Based on [Stevens, W.R.: TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2, pages 878-879].

	* implemented some TCP header options:
	  - EOL: End of option list.
	  - NOP: Padding bytes, currently needed for SACK_PERMITTED and SACK.
	  - MSS: The value of snd_mss (SMSS) is set to the minimum of snd_mss
	(local parameter) and the value specified in the MSS option
	received during connection startup. Based on [RFC 2581, page 1].
	  - SACK_PERMITTED: SACK can only be used if both nodes sent SACK_-
	PERMITTED during connection startup.
	  - SACK: SACK option implemented, based on RFC 2018, RFC 2883 and RFC 3517.

	* implemented Limited Transmit algorithm (RFC 3042):
	  - added new module parameter (limitedTransmitEnabled) to enabled/disabled Limited Transmit algorithm (RFC 3042).
	  - integrated to TCPBaseAlg (can be used for TCPReno, TCPTahoe and TCPNoCongestionControl but not for DumbTCP).

	* implemented changes from RFC 2001 to RFC 2581:
	  - added new module parameter (increasedIWEnabled) to change Initial Window from one segment (RFC 2001)
	(based on MSS) to maximal four segments (min(4*MSS, max (2*MSS, 4380 bytes))) (RFC 3390).
	integrated to TCPBaseAlg (can be used for TCPReno, TCPTahoe and TCPNoCongestionControl but not for DumbTCP).
	  - ACK generation (ack_now = true) RFC 2581, page 6: "(...) a TCP receiver SHOULD send an immediate ACK
	when the incoming segment fills in all or part of a gap in the sequence space."
	  - Re-starting Idle Connections (TODO - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
	RFC 2581, pages 7 and 8: "When TCP has not received a segment for
	more than one retransmission timeout, cwnd is reduced to the value
	of the restart window (RW) before transmission begins.
	For the purposes of this standard, we define RW = IW."

	* NEW tcp parameters:
	  - bool limitedTransmitEnabled: Limited Transmit algorithm (RFC 3042) enabled/disabled
	  - bool increasedIWEnabled: Increased Initial Window (RFC 3390) enabled/disabled
	  - bool delayedAcksEnabled: delayed ACKs enabled/disabled
	  - bool nagleEnabled: Nagle's algorithm (RFC 896) enabled/disabled
	  - bool sackSupport: SACK support (RFC 2018, 2883, 3517) enabled/disabled (SACK will be enabled for a connection if both endpoints support it)

	* NEW tcp vectors:
	  - pipeVector ("pipe"): current sender's estimate of bytes outstanding in the network
	  - sackedBytesVector ("rcvd sackedBytes"): current number of received sacked bytes
	  - numRtosVector ("numRTOs"): total number of RTOs
	  - rcvAdvVector ("advertised window"): current advertised window
	  - rcvWndVector ("receive window"): current receive window
	  - dupAcksVector ("rcvd dupAcks"): current number of received dupAcks
	  - sndSacksVector ("sent sacks"): total number of sent SACK blocks
	  - rcvSacksVector ("rcvd sacks"): total number of received SACK blocks
	  - rcvOooSegVector ("rcvd oooseg"): total number of received out-of-
	order segments
	  - tcpRcvQueueBytesVector ("tcpRcvQueueBytes"): current amount of used
	bytes in tcp receive queue
	  - tcpRcvQueueDropsVector ("tcpRcvQueueDrops"): total number of drops
	in tcp receive queue

	* NEW tcp examples:
	  - inet/examples/inet/ber
	To demonstrate SACK's impact on throughput. The ber (bit error rate) of the channel
	between client and server depends on the selected configuration.
	  - inet/examples/inet/tcpSack
	The dropsGenerator at client's PPP interface deletes certain DATA
	packets. On server side a second dropsGenerator deletes certain
	ACK packets in configs 1-5. For config 6 the node type of the server
	must be changed to 'StandardHostWithDLDuplicatesGenerator' in ned
	file to duplicate certain received DATA packets.
	Different configurations reflect examples from RFC 2018 and RFC 2883
	to evaluate the implementation of optional selective acknowledgment.
	  - inet/examples/extInterface/extServer
	In this example the network consists of one client, one router,
	one internal server and one external (real) server. The client sends
	100 MB of data to the external server using TCP for uplink traffic.
	For downlink traffic the external server may send data to the
	internal server.

	* Other changes:
	  - TCPReno and TCPTahoe use new constant DUPTHRESH (=3) to trigger retransmission (RFC 3517).
	  - implemented PERSIST timer. If data sender is receiving a zero window and
	the REXMIT timer is not running, the PERSIST timer is started.
	  - sending window probes. If PERSIST timer is expired a window probe is
	sent to request a window update.
	  - Restart of REXMIT timer on retransmission is not part of RFC 2581,
	however optional in RFC 3517 if sent during recovery.
	This has been FIXED in TCPReno and TCPTahoe.
	REXMIT timer management is discussed in RFC 2582/3782 (NewReno) and RFC 2988.
	  - FIXED behavior of TCPReno after RTO. After REXMIT timeout TCP Reno
	should start slow start with snd_cwnd = snd_mss.
	If calling "retransmitData();" there is no rexmit limitation (bytesToSend > snd_cwnd)
	therefore "sendData();" has been modified and is called to rexmit outstanding data.
	  - new module parameter 'delayedAcksEnabled' added to enable/disable
	(optional) delayed ACKs.
	  - changed the implementation of delayed ACKs. Full sized segments are
	counted and ack_now bit is set to generate immediate ACK in certain
	cases.
	Based on [Stevens, W.R.: TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2, page 861].
	  - new module parameter 'nagleEnabled' added to enable/disable (optional)
	Nagle's algorithm (RFC 896). The Nagle's algorithm is unchanged and is possibly
	not precisely implemented.
	  - Slightly CHANGED utility function "isSegmentAcceptable" (check
	that segment entirely falls in receive window).
	Based on [RFC 793, page 69].
	  - CHANGED data type of some state variables (e.g. snd_wnd, snd_mss)
	from int/uint to uint32 to simplify use of standard functions
	(e.g. std::min).
	  - slightly changed the update of window information (snd_wnd, snd_wl1, snd_wl2).
	Based on [Stevens, W.R.: TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 2, page 982].

2009-10-17  Rudolf Hornig

	* fixed assert issue with patch submitted by Kyeong Soo (Joseph) Kim. See bug #110

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2009-03-01  Andras Varga

	* fixed bug in TCPConnection::retransmitData(); patch from Claus Faller

2008-06-29  Andras Varga

	* some refactoring: created factory methods for TCPSegment and
	TCPConnection, to allow customizing them via subclassing

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2006-03-22  Andras Varga

	* TCPConnectionEventProc.cc, TCPConnectionRcvSegment.cc: when the user
	issues CLOSE, defer transition to FIN_WAIT_1 until all data are sent.
	(Before this fix the transiton was made immediately, but that was
	harmless, i.e. it didn't affect TCP's external behaviour.)

2006-03-21  Andras Varga

	* TCPConnectionRcvSegment.cc: fixed incorrect behaviour when ACK of SYN
	carries data [reported by Joachim Meichle]

2005-07-20  Andras Varga

	* some sources moved into subdirs queues/ and flavours/

2005-07-14  Andras Varga

	* TCPMain renamed to TCP

2005-07-12  Andras Varga

	* TCPMain.cc, TCPConnectionBase.cc: TCP got confused when it received
	several active/passive opens with same local port number. Now it raises
	an error (this is like EADDRINUSE on *nix)

2005-07-06  Andras Varga

	* TCPConnectionRcvSegment.cc: fixed bug which caused closing of a
	connection to be reported 2MSL (240s) later to the user. Basically,
	the user has to be notified already when the connection enters the
	TIME_WAIT state. (TCP stays in TIME_WAIT for 240s or longer, and
	nothing can happen during that time that's of interest to the user.)

2004-08-05  Andras Varga

	Replaced IPSuite's TcpModule with the new implementation,
	based closely on RFC 793 and follow-up RFCs. The main selling
	points of the new code are extensibility with queue and congestion
	control behavior classes, extensive commenting with references to
	the RFC, clean and modular code, use of new OMNeT++ concepts (i.e.
	control info instead of interface packets).

	If you are interested in the early history of the TCP code, change
	to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- Transport/NewTCP Transport/TCP INET/src/transport/tcp

2004-04-15  Andras Varga

	The directory Transport/NewTCP now contains a completely new TCP
	implementation (incomplete as of Apr 15 2004).

	Motivation:

	   * existing tcpmodule.cc was written before message definitions
	     (.msg files) were introduced into OMNeT++. It uses cPars,
	     C structs carried by pointer-valued cPars and other tricks which
	     have been obsoleted by .msg files by now. This would have to be
	     updated anyway.

	   * tcpmodule.cc contains TCP flavours (congestion control, fast
	     retransmit/recovery, selective acknowledgement etc) hardcoded.
	     It would be much better to get these incorporated in a more
	     flexible way (e.g. as separate objects)

	   * different simulation scenarios require different approaches
	     regarding transmitted data (see below), and this is also difficult
	     to do with tcpmodule.cc. For example:

	      * in one model one might want to transmit a "real" bytes
	        (especially if the application which uses TCP is a ported
	        version of a real socket application)

	      * In other scenarios, "dummy" transmission will do, that is,
	        simulated TCP segments contain do not need to contain any
	        real data (only the number of bytes they represent suffices)
	        -- you'll want to do this when the app is there solely as
	        a traffic generator (e.g. simulated file transfer or telnet
	        session), but actual data is unimportant.

	      * Yet again in other models you need to transmit a sequence
	        of cMessage objects, and you want exactly the same cMessage
	        sequence to be reproduced on the receiver side. (Here every
	        cMessage would map onto a sequence number range in the TCP
	        stream, and the object is passed up to the application when
	        its last byte has arrived on the simulated connection.)

	The new model, in addition to using .msg files, makes two aspects of
	TCP configurable via "plug-in classes":

	   * TCP congestion control, fast retransmit/recovery etc. algorithms
	     are encapsulated into a separate object, subclassed from
	     TCPAlgorithm (an abstract base class). Thus one can create several
	     classes, all subclassed from TCPAlgorithm which provide various
	     TCP behaviours, and choose one of them for any particular
	     simulation. Examples of such classes can be e.g. Reno, NewReno,
	     LinuxTCP, etc. The particular class to be used is selected at
	     runtime (via a module parameter, e.g. from omnetpp.ini). This
	     feature should make it easier to experiment with various flavours
	     of TCP, test experimental congestion control schemes etc.

	   * Second, transmission method ("real" bytes, dummy, cMessage
	     sequence) is encapsulated in the classes derived from the
	     TCPSendQueue/TCPReceiveQueue abstract base classes. The choice
	     of transmission method (class names) can be specified in module
	     parameters, but it is also possible for apps to specify it
	     individually for each connection (in the active/passive open
	     commands).
