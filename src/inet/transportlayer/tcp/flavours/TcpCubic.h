/**
 * \brief The Cubic Congestion Control Algorithm
 *
 * TCP Cubic is a protocol that enhances the fairness property
 * of Bic while retaining its scalability and stability. The main feature is
 * that the window growth function is defined in real time in order to be independent
 * from the RTT. More specifically, the congestion window of Cubic is determined
 * by a function of the elapsed time from the last window reduction.
 *
 * The Cubic code is quite similar to that of Bic.
 * The main difference is located in the method Update, an edit
 * necessary for satisfying the Cubic window growth, that can be tuned with
 * the attribute C (the Cubic scaling factor).
 *
 * Following the Linux implementation, we included the Hybrid Slow Start,
 * that effectively prevents the overshooting of slow start
 * while maintaining a full utilization of the network. This new type of slow
 * start can be disabled through the HyStart attribute.
 *
 * CUBIC TCP is implemented and used by default in Linux kernels 2.6.19
 * and above; this version follows the implementation in Linux 3.14, which
 * slightly differ from the CUBIC paper. It also features HyStart.

 *      https://web.archive.org/web/20080607093013/http://netsrv.csc.ncsu.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/BIC
 * The work starts from the implementation of CUBIC TCP in
 * Sangtae Ha, Injong Rhee and Lisong Xu,
 * "CUBIC: A New TCP-Friendly High-Speed TCP Variant"
 * in ACM SIGOPS Operating System Review, July 2008.
 * Available from:

 *
 * CUBIC integrates a new slow start algorithm, called HyStart.
 * The details of HyStart are presented in
 *  Sangtae Ha and Injong Rhee,
 *  "Taming the Elephants: New TCP Slow Start", NCSU TechReport 2008.
