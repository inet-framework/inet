/**
 * Implements the TCP protocol. Usage and compliance with various RFCs are
 * discussed in the corresponding NED documentation.
 *
 * **Communication with clients**
 *
 * This section describes the interface between the Tcp module and its clients
 * (applications or higher-layer protocols). However, note that implementors
 * of client modules do not necessarily need to know the details described herein.
 * Instead, they can use the TcpSocket utility class which hides the details
 * of talking to Tcp under an easy-to-use class interface.

 * For communication between client applications and TCP, the TcpCommandCode
 * and TcpStatusInd enums are used as message kinds, and TcpCommand
 * and its subclasses are used as control info.
 *
 * To open a connection from a client app, send a cMessage to TCP with
 * TCP_C_OPEN_ACTIVE as message kind and a TcpOpenCommand object filled in
 * and attached to it as control info. (The peer TCP will have to be LISTENing;
 * the server app can achieve this with a similar cMessage but TCP_C_OPEN_PASSIVE
 * message kind.) With passive open, there's a possibility to cause the connection
 * "fork" on an incoming connection, leaving the original connection LISTENing
 * on the port (see the fork field in TcpOpenCommand). Note that TcpOpenCommand
 * allows tcpAlgorithmClass to be specified, which will override the setting
 * in the TCP module. Also note that TcpOpenCommand allows the client to
 * choose between "autoread" and "explicit-read" modes.
 *
 * The client can send data by assigning the TCP_C_SEND message kind to the data
 * packet and sending it to TCP. Received data will be forwarded by TCP to the
 * client as messages with the TCP_I_DATA message kind. This happens
 * automatically in "autoread" mode. In "explicit-read" mode, the client must
 * issue READ requests to receive data. READ requests are cMessages with the
 * TCP_C_READ message kind and a TcpReadCommand control info attached.
 *
 * To close, the client sends a cMessage to TCP with the TCP_C_CLOSE message kind
 * and TcpCommand control info.
 *
 * Tcp sends notifications to the application whenever there's a significant
 * change in the state of the connection: established, remote TCP closed,
 * closed, timed out, connection refused, connection reset, etc. These
 * notifications are also cMessages with message kind TCP_I_xxx
 * (TCP_I_ESTABLISHED, etc.) and TcpCommand as control info.
 *
 * One TCP module can serve several application modules, and several
 * connections per application. When talking to applications, a
 * connection is identified by the socketId that is assigned by the application in
 * the OPEN call.
 *
 * **Sockets**
 *
 * The TcpSocket C++ class is provided to simplify managing TCP connections
 * from applications. TcpSocket handles the job of assembling and sending
 * command messages (OPEN, CLOSE, etc) to TCP, and it also simplifies
 * the task of dealing with packets and notification messages coming from Tcp.
 *
 *
 * **Communication with the IP layer**
 *
 * The TCP model relies on sending and receiving L3AddressReq/L3AddressInd tags
 * attached to TCP segment packets.
 *
 *
 * **Architecture**
 *
 * This section describes the internal architecture of the TCP model.
 * The implementation is composed of several classes (discussion follows below):
 *  - Tcp: the main module class
 *  - TcpConnection: module class that manages a connection
 *  - TcpSendQueue, TcpReceiveQueue: send and receive queues
 *  - TcpAlgorithm: abstract base class for TCP algorithms: DumbTcp, TcpTahoe,
 *    TcpReno, TcpNewReno, etc.
 *
 * Tcp is subclassed from cSimpleModule. It manages socketpair-to-connection
 * mapping, and dispatches segments and user commands to the appropriate
 * TcpConnection object.
 *
 * TcpConnection manages the connection, with the help of other objects.
 * TcpConnection itself implements the basic Tcp "machinery": takes care
 * of the state machine, stores the state variables (TCB), sends/receives
 * SYN, FIN, RST, ACKs, etc.
 *
 * TcpConnection internally relies on 3 objects: send queue, receive queue,
 * and TCP algorithm. The first two are TcpSendQueue and TcpReceiveQueue.
 * They manage the actual data stream, so TcpConnection need to only concern
 * itself with sequence numbers.

 * The TCP algorithm class is subclassed from TcpAlgorithm. Control over
 * retransmissions, congestion control and ACK sending are "outsourced"
 * from TcpConnection into TcpAlgorithm: delayed acks, slow start, fast rexmit,
 * etc. are all implemented in TcpAlgorithm subclasses. This simplifies the
 * design of TcpConnection and makes it a lot easier to implement new Tcp
 * variations such as NewReno, Vegas or LinuxTcp as TcpAlgorithm subclasses.
 *
 * The concrete TcpAlgorithm class to use can be chosen per connection (in OPEN)
 * or in a module parameter.
