====== inet-3.x ======

2015-05-13  ------ inet-2.99.1 released ------

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-12-09  Levente Mészáros

	Renamed common subdirectory to base.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
