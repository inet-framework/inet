	IPsec: fixed TFC support: TFC padding enabled only when the transmit
	protocol has packet length field.

	The TFC padding feature can hide the length of the original packet, and
	might affect the packet encapsulation and de-encapsulation performance.
	This feature takes effect on UDP packets encapsulated by ESP in transport
	mode and on original IP packets encapsulated by ESP in tunnel mode.

	See RFC 4303 2.7
