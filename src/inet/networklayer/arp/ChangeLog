2015-03-18  Levente Mészáros

    Moved interface under contract.

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2015-01-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	ARP refactoring (Andras Varga)
	- ARP is now next to the IPv4 module not below it, so outgoing packets
	  no longer pass through the ARP module. The IPv4 module uses the IARP
	  interface to query the ARP cache and to initiate address resolution.
	- Motivation:
	  (1) performance improvement (datagrams no longer go through ARP)
	  (2) conceptually better (packets to PPP used to go through ARP, too!)
	  (3) more consistent with how IPv6 and NeighbourDiscovery are organized

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

2013-05-03  Alfonso Ariza

	ARP: is now sensitive to IPv4 config changes (reacts to
	NF_INTERFACE_IPv4CONFIG_CHANGED), and invalidates the cache
	if necessary. )

	Original patch modified by Zoltan Bojthe:
	- removed localAddressVector member
	- added 'owner' to ARPCacheEntry (used in GlobalArpCache)

2013-05-09  Levente Meszaros

	mapping an IPv4 multicast address to a multicast MAC address as specified
	in RFC112, section 6.4

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2011-12-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	IPv4 bugfix #469: ARP: global cache is incompatible with dynamic module
	creation

	bug was: The initialize() and destructor functions of the ARP module
	clear the global ARP cache. If it is called during simulation, then any
	subsequent ARP request stops the simulation with an error.

2011-12-15  Andras Varga

	statistics: ARP: wording

2011-08-02  Andras Varga

	Set ETHERTYPE_IPv4 on outgoing packets

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	eliminate some warnings: variable set but not used

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for cppcheck

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-28  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: end-line spaces removed, using spaces.pl in OMNeT++.

	Added GlobalARP support (from INETMANET)

2011-02-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	fix: cannot use "%d" format for size_t on 64-bit systems; use '<<' instead

2011-02-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	Eliminate compile warnings

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	@statistic: added missing 'vector' recording mode

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	update for omnet++ 4.1b3:

	indent changes - from Thomas Reschka

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-07-08  Andras Varga

	* ARP: performance: introduced nicOutBaseGateId for use in send(),
	instead of looking up the gate by name each time

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-08-04  Andras Varga

	ARP code moved from NetworkInterfaces/ARP/ into Network/ARP/.

2004-04-26  Andras Varga

	Initial revision of the ARP code, written from scratch.

	If you are interested in the early history of the ARP code, change
	to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- NetworkInterfaces/ARP Network/ARP INET/src/networklayer/arp
