// description: Multi-hop ad-hoc data dissemination protocol based on
//              probabilistic broadcast: depending on application
//              parameters and network status, each packet will
//              go through a number of transmission attempts, each
//              with a certain probability. How the number of transmissions
//              attempts and probability of forwarding are computed will
//              be derived from the simulations of this protocol.

// Multi-hop ad-hoc data dissemination protocol based on probabilistic broadcast.
//
// This method reduces the number of packets sent on the channel (reducing the
// broadcast storm problem) at the risk of some nodes not receiving the data.
// It is particularly interesting for mobile networks.
// The parameter `maxNbBcast` sets the maximum number of broadcast transmissions of a packet,
// the parameter beta gives the transmission probability for each attempt,
// the parameter bcperiod sets the time between two transmission attempts.
// The parameter `maxFirstBcastBackoff` sets a backoff window before the first transmission attempt,
// and the parameter `timeInQueueAfterDeath` sets the time during which a node remembers
// a packet whose time to live (TTL) expired, avoiding retransmitting it in case it comes back
// in the network because of some problem.
//
simple ProbabilisticBroadcast extends NetworkProtocolBase like INetworkProtocol

        // That way the message is known if the node receives one of its

        // MAC backoff, propagation delay, and clock drift.
