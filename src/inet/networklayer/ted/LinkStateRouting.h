/**
 * Implements a minimalistic link state routing protocol that employs flooding.
 * Flooding works like this:
 *
 * When a router receives a link state packet, it merges the packet contents
 * into its own link state database (ted). If the packet contained new information
 * (ted got updated), the router broadcasts the ted contents to all its other
 * neighbours; otherwise (when the packet didn't contain any new info), nothing
 * happens.
 *
 * Also: when the announceMsg timer expires, LinkStateRouting sends out an initial link state
 * message. (Currently this happens only once, at the beginning of the simulation).
 * The "request" bit in the message is set then, asking neighbours to send back
 * their link state databases. (FIXME why's this? redundant messaging: same msg
 * is often sent twice: both as reply and as voluntary "announce").
 *
 * TODO discover peers by "hello". Peers are those from which the router has received
 * a Hello in the last X seconds. Link info to all peers are maintained;
 * links to ex-peers (those haven't heard of for more than X seconds) are assumed
 * to be down.
 *
 * See NED file for more info.
