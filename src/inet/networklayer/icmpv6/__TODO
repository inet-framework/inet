- in the class: int NUM_OF_SOLICIT_SENT, simtime_t MAX_ANYCAST_DELAY_TIME:
  turn them into #define or const double

- initiateDAD(): get rid of chaining of contextPointers, and dup'ing of NS packet.

- also: createAndSend...Packet() methods should return void NOT the packet!
  (it's not safe to keep the pointer after sending out the packet).

- assignTentativeAddress(cMessage *timerMsg): remove message as argument (why
  is it passed in the 1st place? the function doesn't need it)
