2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)

	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	Default Router Selection is implemented as specified in RFC 4861 6.3.6:
	first the reachable routers are tried in round-robin, then
	if there are no known reachable routers, then the others are selected
	in round-robin order.

	Earlier always the first one was selected, which violates the RFC.

2012-01-03  Tamas Borbely

	Fix #476: now IPv6 Neighbour Discovery does not initiate DAD
	if the dupAddrDetecTransmits variable is set to 0. The autoconfigured
	addresses become permanent without checking their uniqueness.

2011-12-21  Tamas Borbely

	Fix #492: if a network contained an Ethernet switch, the unsolicited
	RA messages are sent too often (between 30 and 70ms). This shorter
	periods was used, because Ethernet switches were mistakenly identified
	as wireless access points.

	    Now the shorter periods are used only if the router has wireless interface
	or directly attached to a wireless access point.

2011-12-20  Tamas Borbely

	Fix #474: now ICMPv6 error packets are truncated to the minimum MTU.
	Before this change, they could erronously send large datagrams
	that could not be delivered to the target without fragmentation.

2011-12-15  Tamas Borbely

	Fix #475: now it is possible to send a ping to a multicast address.
	The bug was that the source address of the ping reply was always set
	to the destination of the ping request, but multicast addresses
	are not allowed as source. Now the ICMPv6 module sets the source
	address	to the unicast address belonging to the interface on which
	the echo request was received.

2011-12-21  Andras Varga

	IPv6NeighborDiscovery: added @signal[startDAD]

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)

	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

	Monash University; code skeleton and some initial code
