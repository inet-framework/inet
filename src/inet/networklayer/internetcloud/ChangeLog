2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-12-17  Zoltan Bojthe

2014-11-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	Network Protocol module should delete queued datagrams, hooks shouldn't
	delete/send/scheduleat/take datagrams

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

2012-09-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	A new module to model an "internet cloud". The module can be used
	to model the throughput, packet delay and packet drop of the
	Internet or other large scale networks.

2012-09-07  Zoltan Bojthe

	Initial implementation of the internet cloud node. The component can
	be configured to model packet delay, datarate and drop probability
	between each input-output interface pair. The parameter matrix
	is provided as an XML configuration file. See the README file
	in src/nodes/internetcloud for further details.
