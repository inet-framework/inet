2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

2012-03-12  Tamas Borbely

	Adapted to change: IPv4 can send a multicast datagram to one
	interface only. This interface is specified as a socket option
	or configured in the routing table.

	The LDP module now creates a separate UDP socket for each
	multicast interface of the node, sets the multicast interface
	on them, and sends a copy of LDP-Hellos via each socket.

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	Adapted to change: "host" in IPv4Route renamed to "destination"

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-07-28  Andras Varga

	UDP apps: change to UDPSocket; updated for the UDP API changes

	No change in functionality.

	Details:
	- UDPAppBase was eliminated because it only contained functinality
	already present in UDPSocket.
	- Also, some 'msg'->'pk' renaming.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-03-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	Features: add more features

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	TCP datatransfermode fixes

2011-01-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	using getEncapsulatedPacket() instead deprecated getEncapsulatedMsg()

2010-06-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	indent changes - from Thomas Reschka

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-09-09  Tamas Borbely

	LDP: made combatible with MSVC 8.0. (In debug mode it asserts
	that the std::vector iterator is not moved before begin().)

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-11-02  Andras Varga

	Checked in Vojta Janota's implementation (loosely based on Andras' code)

2004-09-20  Andras Varga

	Started to reimplement LDP from scratch (NewLDP.h, NewLDP.cc)

2003-2004  Andras Varga

	Some cleanup and refactoring of the original code. See
	mpls/ChangeLog for details.

2003-09-19  Andras Varga

	Added MPLS/LDP/RESVP-TE models written by Xuan Thang Nguyen at
	University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) as a Capstone project.
	Original URL (now defunct):
	    http://charlie.it.uts.edu.au/~tkaphan/xtn/capstone/

	If you are interested in the early history of the LDP code,
	change to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- Network/LDP INET/src/networklayer/ldp
