package inet.networklayer.configurator.ipv4;

//
// This module has one instance per network node, and it acts like a bridge
// between the node and the network's global configurator module,
// ~Ipv4NetworkConfigurator.
//
// ~Ipv4NetworkConfigurator only computes and remembers configuration data
// (assigned IP addresses, static routes, etc), but doesn't configure the nodes'
// routing tables and interfaces accordingly. The actual configuration is
// carried out by this module, at network initialization time and also when
// the node restarts (i.e. after a shutdown or a crash.)
//
// This module is needed because of failure/restart scenarios:
// ~Ipv4NetworkConfigurator would not be able to configure the node after
// a restart, because being a global module, it doesn't know about node
// lifecycle events.
