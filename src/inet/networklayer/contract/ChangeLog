2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Network layer abstraction (Levente Meszaros, Andras Varga):

	  INetworkProtocolControlInfo, NetworkProtocolCommand

	Directory restructuring:
	- contents split to ipv4/, ipv6/, generic/

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

2013-05-15  Levente Meszaros

	IPvXAddressResolver: Extended interface IPv4 address lookup: when the
	interface is not yet configured for IPv4, it tries to get the address
	from IPv4NetworkConfigurator.

2013-02-01  Andras Varga

	IPv4Address: renamed getBroadcastAddress() to makeBroadcastAddress()

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

	  converter function

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-06-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	IPv4Address:
	- added a parameter to str() function that allows choosing
	  between "0.0.0.0" and "<unspec>" when the address is unspecified
	  (when its value is 0)
	- made the uint32 constructor explicit

	IPvXAddressResolver: resolving netmask if needed
	- added support for 'x.x.x.x/' syntax
	  (which will return the netmask instead of the ip address)
	- added ADDR_MASK enum (to get the netmask instead of the address)
	- NOTE: netmask resolving is implemented only for IPv4

2012-05-15  Tamas Borbely

	The bad Uint128 conversions were added just a few commits earlier.

2012-02-04  Andras Varga

	IPv4Address: keepFirstBits() was bogus, removed; new methods

	keepFirstBits() was actually "keep first 32-n bits"

	New methods:
	- makeNetmask(int)
	- isValidNetmask()

	Use isValidNetmask() in RoutingTable

	IPv4Address,RoutingTable: various fixes.

	Fixed IPv4Address::getNetmaskLength, it couldn't return 1. Fixed

	int128/uint128: removed IP address and MAC address related functions
	from int128/uint128 classes

2012-01-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	IPvXAddressResolver: bugfix: findRoutingTableOf(), findRoutingTable6Of()
	functions should return NULL if routing table not found

2012-01-27  Zoltan Bojthe

	networklayer/ipv4/contract and networklayer/ipv6/contract merged back to
	networklayer/contract

	Contract is now always available, regardless of feature settings. This
	reduces the amount of ifdefs needed.

2012-01-27  Tamas Borbely

	IPv6Address

2011-07-24  Andras Varga

	cosmetics

2011-07-24  Andras Varga

	IPvXAddress: added isMulticast()

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	Use cStringTokenizer and IPvXAddressResolver for parsing.

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2010-11-22  Rudolf Hornig

	Added GlobalARP support (from INETMANET)

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	Code style changes:

	- tab-to-space conversion
	- '{' to new line
	- too long lines
	- remove trailing whitespace from lines
	- indentation

	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-10-28  Andras Varga

	* IPControlInfo.msg: added outputPort field

2005-08-04  Andras Varga
