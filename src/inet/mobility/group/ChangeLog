2022-03-10  Rudolf Hornig

	Re-licensed mobility code from GPL -> LGPL.

2021-03-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	Changed if-else-if ladders in initialize() to separate if statements because
	different stages may have the same number.

2021-01-11  ------ inet-4.3.0 released ------

2020-06-09  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed storing and returning a reference to the current position/velocity.

2020-06-08  Levente Mészáros

	Refactored mobility models to support returning const references.

	Fixed reading MoBAN parameters in release mode.

2018-10-02  Levente Mészáros

	Added INITSTAGE_GROUP_MOBILITY.

2018-09-27  Levente Mészáros

	Split INITSTAGE_PHYSICAL_ENVIRONMENT_2 into INITSTAGE_PHYSICAL_OBJECT_CACHE and INITSTAGE_MOBILITY.

2018-06-27  ------ inet-4.0.0 released ------

2018-05-29  Levente Mészáros

	Added makePathForFile call before opening any output file to make sure the directory exists.

2018-04-25  Levente Mészáros

	Moved code from updateVisualRepresentation into the standard refreshDisplay module function.

2018-04-13  ------ inet-3.99.3 released ------

2018-03-20  Levente Mészáros

	Renamed speed to velocity where appropriate. Speed is a scalar, velocity is a vector quantity.

2018-02-13  TÖRÖK Attila

	Factored out MovingMobilityBase::orient() to allow overriding.

2017-12-22  ------ inet-3.99.2 released ------

2017-12-20  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renaming:
	    MoBANCoordinator -> MoBanCoordinator
	    MoBANLocal -> MoBanLocal

2017-12-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	Removed unnecessary cPar::xmlValue(), cPar::boolValue(), cPar::longValue() calls.

	Motivation: rely on cast operators instead because they can detect
	overflows (when the value is cast to a smaller integer type that can not
	represent it). Removed unnecessary .longvalue() calls. Replaced to
	.intValue() in comparisons.

2017-11-23  Levente Mészáros

	Removed cObject base class from Coord and EulerAngles.

	The reason why cObject was a base class was that we used to emit signals
	with coordinates, but that's not the case anymore. There are no virtual
	functions in those classes and cObject would introduce an unnecessary
	vptr.

2015-04-22  Rudolf Hornig

	Removed TraCI mobility as it is part of the Veins framework and is
	maintained there.

2015-04-22 Rudolf Hornig

	TraCI mobility was removed. It is part of the Veins project
	and it was seriously out of date.

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-12-17  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed memory management problems found by valgrind memcheck.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE
