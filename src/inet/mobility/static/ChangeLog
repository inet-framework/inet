2018-06-27  ------ inet-4.0.0 released ------

2018-06-04  Levente Mészáros

	Replaced 0/0 NED parameter values with nan.

2018-04-13  ------ inet-3.99.3 released ------

2018-03-22  Levente Mészáros

	Replaced type of angle member variables with rad and added degree around parameters.
	Replace @unit(rad) with @unit(deg) in NED files because its more human readable.

2018-03-20  Levente Mészáros

	Moved static LinearNodeDistributionMobility into static folder.
	Renamed LinearNodeDistributionMobility to StaticLinearMobility.
	Renamed speed to velocity where appropriate. Speed is a scalar, velocity is a vector quantity.

2018-02-13  TÖRÖK Attila

	Factor out MovingMobilityBase::orient() to allow overriding.

2018-02-06  Levente Mészáros

	Added initial orientation parameters to StationaryMobility at least.
	Cleaned up how StationaryMobility implements IMobility.

2018-01-12  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed double and int inconsistency: NED vs. INI and NED vs. C++

	mobility: Fixing bug in StaticConcentricMobility

	The calculation was unnecessary complex, leading to rounding errors
	during the node positioning so nodes were positioned above each other.
	This approach is maybe insignificantly slower, but probably not since the
	sqrt is no longer necessary.

	StationaryMobility: added support for geographic positioning:
	initialLatitude, initialLongitude, initialAltitude parameters

	Added StaticConcentricMobility similar to StaticGridMobility, but it places
	nodes on concentric circles.
