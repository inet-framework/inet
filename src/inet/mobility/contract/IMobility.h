/**
 * Abstract base class defining the public interface that must be provided by
 * all mobility modules. The mobility interface uses a 3D right-handed Euclidean
 * coordinate system.
 *
 * Coordinates are represented by 3D double precision tuples called Coord. The
 * coordinates are in X, Y, Z order, they are measured in metres. Conceptually,
 * the X axis goes to the right, the Y axis goes forward, the Z axis goes upward.
 *
 * Orientations are represented by 3D double precision Tait-Bryan (Euler) tuples
 * called EulerAngles. The angles are in Z, Y', X" order that is often called
 * intrinsic rotations, they are measured in radians. The default (unrotated)
 * orientation is along the X axis. Conceptually, the Z axis rotation is heading,
 * the Y' axis rotation is descending, the X" axis rotation is bank. For example,
 * positive rotation along the Z axis rotates X into Y (turns left), positive
 * rotation along the Y axis rotates Z into X (leans forward), positive rotation
 * along the X axis rotates Y into Z (leans right).
