// This mobility module combines the trajectory of several other mobility modules
// using superposition. In other words, the position, velocity and acceleration
// is the sum of the respective quantities of all submodules.
//
// This module allows to form a group mobility model by using a shared mobility
// component in the mobility of each group member. It also allows to seprate the
// mobility model of initial positioning from positioning during the simulation.
// It also makes possible to separate the mobility model of positioning from the
// mobility model of orientation.
