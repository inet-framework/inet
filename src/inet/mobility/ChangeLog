	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	Split models directory into multiple directories:
	 contract - specifies the interface of mobility models
	 common - shared files among mobility models that are not complete mobility models
	 static - mobility models that actually don't move
	 single - single mobility models controlling only one moving object
	 group - group mobility models controlling multiple interlinked moving objects

	Moved the mobility models into the models/ subdirectory, so this folder
	only contains module interfaces. This was necessary so that we can
	turn mobility into an optional project feature (see .oppfeatures)

	See earlier history in the ChangeLog of models/.
