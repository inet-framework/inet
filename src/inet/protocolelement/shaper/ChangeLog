	EligibilityTimeMeter: Fixed number of token statistic to not have
	negative values.

	Previously if the rate of incoming traffic was higher than the rate of
	outgoing traffic, the number of tokens statistic could be negative which
	doesn't really make sense. The number of tokens statistics is created by
	emitting values into the future such that a sawtooth pattern is created.
	The actual behavior of the ATS is not influenced by this change because
	the number of tokens is just a derived statistic for a virtual token
	bucket.
