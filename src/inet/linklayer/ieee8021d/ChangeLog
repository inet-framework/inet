2015-02-12  Zoltan Bojthe

    Fixed BPDU packet length.

2015-01-07  Zoltan Bojthe

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-12-16  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2014-11-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed memory management problems found by valgrind memcheck.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

====== inet-2.x ======

	Ieee802.1d: Added missing INET_API macros

2014-03-19  ------ inet-2.3.0 released ------

2013-10-30  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	STP: added switch-related STP/RSTP config parameters.

2013-10-28  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	EtherSwitch, IEEE8021DRelay: changed to work with scenarios without STP.

2013-10-24  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	EtherSwitch: EtherSwitch now supports Spanning Tree algorithm.

	ISpanningTree: moduleinterface added to supports different versions of
	Spanning Tree protocols.

	SpanningTree: module renamed to "STP", this abbreviation refer to the
	protocol described in IEEE 802.1D-1998.
	STPTester and IEEE8021DInterfaceData moved to ieee8021d folder.

2013-10-17  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	IEEE8021DRelay: module added. This relay module is intended to work with
	both STP and RSTP. IEEE8021DBPDU: BPDU message added for RSTP/STP.

2013-11-07 Benjamin Seregi

	STP: added IEEE 802.1D-1998 implementation of Spanning Tree Protocol.
	The source code is based on ANSA (https://github.com/kvetak/ANSA)
	implementation.

	RSTP: added IEEE 802.1D-2004 implementation of Spanning Tree Protocol.
	The source code is based on Juan Luis Garrote Molinero's implementation
	from INETMANET

	IEEE8021DInterfaceData: InterfaceEntry is extended with IEEE8021DInterfaceData.
	It is created to contain additional port interface information of an
	EtherSwitch (e.g. is the port forwarding or not?).

2013-01-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added vlan code from inetmanet - 2996f0d703dc47b54d6262ae18b60f7a9e3e9757
