	Added NF_LINK_BREAK notification. This enables adhoc routing protocols to
	work correctly with this mac protocol.

2015-04-22 Rudolf Hornig

	routing protocols (i.e. AODV) to function properly.

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2015-01-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed defects found by static code analyzer (Coverity).

2015-01-05  Zoltan Bojthe

	Replaced getParentModule calls with module parameters.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

2014-01-22  Levente Meszaros

	Ported the MAC protocol from MiXiM and adapted to the MAC protocol contract.
