2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include

	both STP and RSTP. IEEE8021DBPDU: BPDU message added for RSTP/STP.

2013-10-11  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	MACAddressTable: Some (eg.: STP, RSTP) protocols may need to change
	agingTime

2013-09-18  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	MACAddressTable:

	- MACAddressTable now has removeAgedEntriesIfNeeded() for efficient MAC
	 table purge.
	- Added clearTable() for lifecycle.

	MACRelayUnit: Added a simplified MACRelayUnit. It was necessary because
	MAC address table management has been separated from MACRelayUnitBase
	module.

	IMACRelayUnit: This moduleinterface changed to work with MACRelayUnit.
	There are no need for MAC address table configuration parameters anymore.

	EtherSwitch: Added MACAddressTable.

2013-09-12  Benjamin Seregi (benmartin92)

	Switch: MACAddressTable changes:

	- Now it uses std::map for efficient Address Table search and access
	- Some major renaming: registerMAC -> updateTableWithAddress,
	 resolveMAC -> getPortForAddress, etc.
	- Some parts of code are based on MACRelayUnitBase.
	- resolveMAC/getPortForAddress: outputPorts removed from parameters
	 as it is not needed because getPortForAddress always returns a
	 single port.

2013-11-07 Benjamin Seregi

	MACAddressTable: new module added because MACAddressTable was separated
	from the RelayUnit. The new MACTable is ready for future VLAN support.

	IEEE8021DRelay: added a new relay for supporting STP/RSTP protocols.

	Fix for bug #355: pauseInterval calculation is wrong in MACRelayUnits

	Added a new pauseFinished array for storing the finish time of the last
	PASE for each port. Finish times differ when datarates differ on ports.

	Also add a config for examples/ethernet/test/switch example for testing
	PAUSE.

	Bug description: The pause interval was calculated from 100kbps instead
	of the actual datarate [check-in 2011-12-08]

2011-07-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fix for bug #351: Ethernet PAUSE frames are dropped.

	Solution: MACRelayUnitBase to set dest=MULTICAST_PAUSE_ADDRESS
	on outgoing PAUSE frames.

	Bug description: Ethernet PAUSE frames are generated in EtherEncap,
	EtherLLC and MACRelayUnitBase classes. However the destination address
	is not filled in, so the receiving MACs drop the frame, because it is
	not destined to them (unless in promiscous mode). This makes the flow
	control ineffective.

	The destination address of the frame may be set to either the unique DA
	of the station to be paused, or to the globally assigned multicast
	address 01-80-C2-00-00-01 (hex). This multicast address has been
	reserved by the IEEE 802.3 standard for use in MAC Control PAUSE frames.
	It is also reserved in the IEEE 802.1D bridging standard as an address
	that will not be forward by bridges. This ensures the frame will not
	propagate beyond the local link segment. [check-in 2011-12-08]

	wireless port

	The AP management send back packets to radio

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

	Module interface renaming.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2004-05-10  Andras Varga

	* EtherMAC: auto MAC address assignment

	* EtherMAC: auto-configuration of transmission rate and duplex/half duplex i
	  mode.

	* it's no longer an error if EtherMAC is not connected to the network
	  ("unplugged cable")

	* elaboration of Ethernet frame types: Ethernet II, 802.3 with LLC,
	  802.3 with LLC and SNAP.

	* added EtherEncap, which does encapsulation/decapsulation with
	  Ethernet II frames.

	* communication between LLC and higher layers changed: now it uses
	  controlInfo() as introduced in OMNeT++ 3.0

	* PAUSE handling fixed: PAUSE frames to be sent have now priority
	  in the MAC (they overtake normal frames in the queue).
	  MACRelayUnits: minimal time interval introduced that must elapse
	  before sending another PAUSE frame.

	* new example network: models a very large Ethernet LAN. Ini files
	  for old example networks available in test/ subdir.

	* sample application changed to EtherAppCli+EtherAppSrv. EtherAppCli
	  sends requests of at configurable intervals to EtherAppSrv.
	  Each request contains how many bytes EtherAppSrv should send back
	  in response. If this number is 0, no frames are sent; if it is
	  larger than ~1500, several frames are sent back.

2004-04-26  Andras Varga

	* Checkin of the Ethernet model, including the switch relay unit.
	The model was largely written during my stay between February
	and October 2003 at CTIE, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia,
	on the invitation of Dr. Ahmet Sekercioglu.
