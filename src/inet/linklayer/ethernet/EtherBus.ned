package inet.linklayer.ethernet;

//
// Implements the shared coaxial cable for classic Ethernet.
//
// The ethg[i] gates represent taps. Messages arriving on a tap
// travel on the bus on both directions, and copies of it are sent out
// on every other tap after delays proportional to their distances.
//
// For the model to work correctly, all connecting links (both incoming
// and outgoing ones) must have the same datarate.
//
// Messages are not interpreted by the bus model in any way, thus the bus
// model is not specific to Ethernet.
//
// It is allowed to disconnect/reconnect links at runtime. However,
// the model does not support changing the tap positions or adding/removing
// taps at runtime.
