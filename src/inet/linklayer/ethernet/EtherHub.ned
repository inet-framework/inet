package inet.linklayer.ethernet;

//
// A generic wiring hub model.
//
// ethg[i] gates represent ports. Messages arriving on a port are broadcast
// to every other port. For the model to work correctly, all connecting
// links (both incoming and outgoing ones) must have the same datarate.
//
// Messages are not interpreted by the hub model in any way, thus the hub
// model is not specific to Ethernet. Messages may represent anything, from
// the beginning of a frame transmission to end (or abortion) of transmission.
//
// It is allowed to dynamically unconnect/reconnect ports of the hub, and also
// to change the size of ethg[] to add/remove ports. However, the model only
// checks the equivalence of input/output datarates on startup; you are
// responsible that links added at runtime have have the correct datarate.
