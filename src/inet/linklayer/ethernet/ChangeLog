	backport: msg files: legacy enum(Foo) syntax changed to @enum(Foo)

2013-12-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	MACAddressTable: changed default value of agingTime parameter -
	fingerprints changed

2013-12-17  Benmartin92

	MACAddressTable: bugfixes (memory leak and wrong behavior) in flush() and
	updateTableWithAddress() - flush() erased wrong ports (j <--> cur). -
	updateTableWithAddress() missed to set addressTable to VLAN ID 0 (after
	clearTable()).

2013-12-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	uses MACRelayUnit instead of MACRelayUnitNP/MACRelayUnitPP

2013-12-05  Benmartin92

	Ieee8021DRelay: added interface autoselection.

2013-12-04  Benmartin92

	STP/RSTP/Relays: MAC table module access changed to work with
	IMACAddressTable.

2013-12-04  Benmartin92

	IMACAddressTable: added class and moduleinterface for MAC tables.

2013-11-21  Zsolt Prontvai (prozsolt)

	EtherMAC: transmission coloring

	With a new parameter you can turn on/off transmission coloring

2013-11-07  Benmartin92

	Relay: folder name Relay -> relay - added isStpAware: if the switch is
	STP/RSTP unaware then all its ports are forwarding (and learning) -
	IEEE8021DRelay implements IMACRelayUnit interface - added STPGate to each
	IMACRelayUnit implementations

2013-10-31  Benmartin92

	IEEE8021DRelay: EthernetIIFrame --> EtherFrame.

2013-10-28  Benmartin92

	EtherSwitch, IEEE8021DRelay: changed to work with scenarios without STP.

2013-10-17  Benmartin92

	IEEE8021DRelay: module added. This relay module is intended to work with
	both STP and RSTP. IEEE8021DBPDU: BPDU message added for RSTP/STP.

2013-09-18  Benmartin92

	Switch:

	MACAddressTable:

	- MACAddressTable now has removeAgedEntriesIfNeeded() for efficient MAC
	 table purge.
	- Added clearTable() for lifecycle.

	MACRelayUnit: Added a simplified MACRelayUnit. It was necessary because
	MAC address table management has been separated from MACRelayUnitBase
	module.

	IMACRelayUnit: This moduleinterface changed to work with MACRelayUnit.
	There are no need for MAC address table configuration parameters anymore.

	EtherSwitch: Added MACAddressTable.

	Examples: ethernet/lans/largeNet example changed to work with the new
	RelayUnit.

	MACAddressTableAccess: MACAddressTable access name changed to macTable.
	Switch: predefined address table support added to MACAddressTable.
	Switch: MAC address comparator added to AddressTable.

2013-09-12  Benmartin92

	Switch: MACAddressTable changes:

	- Now it uses std::map for efficient Address Table search and access
	- Some major renaming: registerMAC -> updateTableWithAddress,
	 resolveMAC -> getPortForAddress, etc.
	- Some parts of code are based on MACRelayUnitBase.
	- resolveMAC/getPortForAddress: outputPorts removed from parameters
	 as it is not needed because getPortForAddress always returns a
	 single port.

2013-08-22  ------ inet-2.2.0 released ------

2013-07-29  Zoltan Bojthe

	MACBase and it descendants: added clearQueue() for clearing outgoing queue
	at CRASH operation

2013-07-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherMACBase: bugfix: now it has two init stages because isNodeUp() uses another
	module that must be accessed in stage 1 or later only.

2013-06-27  Zoltan Bojthe

	- EtherMAC: throws error when receiving JAM in fullduplex mode
	- EthernetInterface: added encapType parameter
	- Replaced EtherMAC modules with EthernetInterface in the EtherSwitch and AccessPoint
	  modules
	- added EtherEncapDummy module
	- EthernetInterface.ned: refactoring. No functional changes.
	- switch: MACRelay uses interfacetable/interfaceentry instead of direct
	  access to the EtherMAC module

2013-06-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	- MACRelayUnit: added lifecycle support
	- MACRelayUnitPP: added timer pointer to PortBuffer
	  so self messgages can be clean up at the end.

2013-04-23  Levente Meszaros

	Ethernet: Adapted to lifecycle operations.

2013-04-09  Andras Varga

	Introduced MACBase (INotifiable and ILifecycle), all MACs
	adapted to it

2013-03-21  Levente Meszaros

	Ethernet: Fixed interface name when EtherMAC is directly added to a node
	instead of inside a NIC module.

2013-02-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed IFG sending:
	Wait IFG only between frames instead always wait IFG before send a frame.

	The IEEE 802.3 spec explicitly says that IFG should be *after* frames,
	not before.

	http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.3-2008_section1.pdf

	Section 4.2.3.2.1, full duplex operation:
	       After the last bit of a transmitted frame, (that is, when transmitting
	       changes from true to false), the MAC continues to defer for a proper
	       interPacket-Gap (see 4.2.3.2.2) And further on (4.2.3.2.2):
	       This is intended to provide interpacket recovery time for other CSMA/CD
	       sublayers and for the physical medium."

	Bugfix in EtherMacFullDuplex: when external queue was used and
	received a Pause frame, send was stopped sometimes.

	Added tests.

2013-01-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	- EtherLLC: optimisation
	- ethernet interface: added IEtherEncap moduleinterface
	- etherMAC: Instead of silent padding too short frames, throws a runtime error.

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

2012-11-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherMacBase: Added the detection transmission channel's 'disabled'
	parameter

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-07-11  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed connection detection:
	When two modules are connected, EtherMAC now throws error if
	the phys gates are not connected using a transmission channel.
	Previously, connection status was set to "not connected" if
	modules were connected via idealChannel or other non-transmission
	channel which was very misleading.

2012-06-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed netwIn, netwOut gates to upperLayerIn, upperLayerOut

2012-04-27  Tamas Borbely

	Added optional ITrafficConditioner modules into the
	ingress and egress path of EthernetInterface.

2012-04-26  Tamas Borbely

	EthernetInterface: EthDropTailQosQueue has been replaced with
	EtherQoSQueue. EtherQosQueue handles PAUSE frames, and can
	be parametrized with an IOutputQueue module which serves the
	data frames.

2012-04-26  Tamas Borbely

	EthernetInterface: the inner queue is the default queue.
	(It was an external DropTailQueue before.)

2012-04-24  Tamas Borbely

	EthernetInterface: compound modules are accepted as external queue
	module. The module must implement IOutputQueue, and the C++
	class of the simple module connected to the "out" gate must
	implement IPassiveQueue.

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2011-02-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherMAC: checked in a series of commits that implement reconnect
	support for half-duplex mode. (With full-duplex mode it has already
	been supported.)

	The problem is that when the link is re-created or re-enabled,
	the MAC does not know about the ongoing transmissions on the wire
	(by having missed the corresponding EtherFrame/EtherJam/EtherIFG
	messages that are sent at the beginning of the transmissions),
	so it cannot immediately start the CSMA/CD procedure. (Note that
	this is not a problem in full-duplex mode which doesn't need
	carrier sense.)

	To solve this, we have introduced a special "reconnect" state
	(RX_RECONNECT_STATE), during which the MAC listens on the channel
	in order to pick up the channel state. Transmission may only begin
	after the reconnect period is over. The length of the reconnect
	period is the duration of the maximum-size frame. We have assumed
	that the finite reconnect period is not a problem for most simulation
	use cases.

	Also, a set of related disconnect/reconnect related improvements
	were made in EtherHub and EtherBus.

2011-12-22  Andras Varga

	statistics revised:

	- record packet counts in a less confusing way: as rcvdPk:count instead
	  of packetBytes(rcvdPk):count or rcvdPkBytes:count; total bytes is now
	  recorded as rcvdPk:sum(packetBytes)
	- standardizing on lower case statistics titles
	- EtherEncap, EtherLLC: emit cPacket* instead of packet byte length
	- signal/statistic renaming: rcvdPkBytesFromHL --> encapPk,
	  rcvdPkBytesFromMAC --> decapPk, sentPause --> pauseSent,
	  passedUpPkBytes --> passedUpPk, etc.
	- removed "Statistics" sections from docu, as @statistic are self-describing

2011-12-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherMAC/~FullDuplex: refined @signal declarations: type=cPacket
	changed to type=EtherFrame

2011-12-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	EtherMAC,EtherMACFullDuplex: emitssion of packetSentToLowerSignal
	moved from startFrameTransmission() to handleEndTxPeriod()

2011-12-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Ethernet: frameByteLength

	- EtherFrame: renamed origByteLength to frameByteLength
	- EtherMAC/FullDuplex:
	  - throw exception if EtherFrame from upper layer is shorter than 64 bytes
	  - store original frame length once (in processFrameFromUpperLayer())

2011-12-08  Zoltan Bojthe

	Checked in a branch (topic/etherfixes) with a lot of improvements on
	the Ethernet model. Details:

	* fixes for PAUSE frames: set dest address to MULTICAST_PAUSE_ADDRESS
	  if it was unspecified

	* MACRelayUnitNP/PP: calculate PAUSE finish times based on the txrate
	  of the corresponding ports

	* Added EtherFrameClassifier for QoS queues

	* EthernetInterface:
	  - moved queue module to between EtherEncap and EtherMAC modules;
	  - use QoS queue
	  - use empty string instead of "NoQueue" to select the internal queue

	* EtherMAC, EtherMACFullDuplex, EtherMACBase:
	  - implemented 40G, 100G Ethernet
	  - the "duplexEnabled" parameter was renamed to "duplexMode"
	  - EtherMACFullDuplex now throws an error when you try to configure it
	    to be half-duplex
	  - the "carrierExtension" NED parameter was removed (as it is not really
	    an option: it is mandatory for Gigabit Ethernet in half duplex mode)
	  - refactoring: moved several functions from EtherMACBase to EtherMAC/
	    EtherMACFullDuplex for readability, and simplified  EtherMACFullDuplex
	    by removing halfduplex-related code
	  - bugfix: do not count PREAMBLE and SFX into the frame length when
	    padding frames to the minimal length
	  - bugfix: slot time for Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet was wrong
	  - bugfix: the original inner queue stored the PAUSE frames in reverse
	    order at the top of queue; we now cQueue with compare function as
	    a priority queue
	  - bugfix: when a transmission was finished, and a PAUSE frame had
	    been received during the transmission, then the sent frame was not
	    deleted but retransmitted when the PAUSE time elapsed
	  - bugfix for EtherMACFullDuplex: PAUSE frames with bit errors were
	    not discarded
	  - emit only one signal when sending up a frame (removed passedUpPkBytes
	    signal)
	  - changed emitted values in most signals: emit packet objects instead of
	    byte counts
	  - removed NotificationBoard support (one can use signals instead
	    where needed)
	  - do not calculate txrate-related parameters when module is not connected
	  - added more error detections
	  - fixes for dest address check on received messages (will need to be
	    revised when implementing management of multicast address)
	  - changed maximum cable length violation limits to be based on meters
	  - some fixes for reconnecting (incomplete)

	* Ethernet.h: renamed some constants for readability

	* Renamed EtherPadding message to EtherIFG

	* Added SNAP support (also added TODO notes to linklayer/ieee80211, and
	  networklayer/arp|ipv6|manetrouting that they should set the etherType)

	* ARP: set correct etherType on outgoing packets

	* bugfix: buffer was too small for some sprintf() statements

	* added missing @labels to NED files

	* EtherBus: bugfix (used tap[-1] if only one node was connected)

	* added examples

	* comments editing, code styling, optimizations, added TODOs

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the

	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-02-03  Levente Meszaros

	  visualization)

	* EtherMAC2: performance: only fire notifications if someone is listening

	* EtherMAC2: made notification consistent with PPP: use TxDetails as

	* created EtherMAC2, which is a simplified, duplex-only version of
	  EtherMAC (i.e. it does not contain the CSMA/CD algorithm)

	Patch for getting it to work as IPSuite network interface by Emin
	Ilker Cetinbas [niw3@yahoo.com], Sept 2004.

	* EtherMAC: auto MAC address assignment

	* EtherMAC: auto-configuration of transmission rate and duplex/half duplex i
	  mode.

	* it's no longer an error if EtherMAC is not connected to the network
	  ("unplugged cable")

	* elaboration of Ethernet frame types: Ethernet II, 802.3 with LLC,
	  802.3 with LLC and SNAP.

	* added EtherEncap, which does encapsulation/decapsulation with
	  Ethernet II frames.

	* communication between LLC and higher layers changed: now it uses
	  controlInfo() as introduced in OMNeT++ 3.0

	* PAUSE handling fixed: PAUSE frames to be sent have now priority
	  in the MAC (they overtake normal frames in the queue).
	  MACRelayUnits: minimal time interval introduced that must elapse
	  before sending another PAUSE frame.

	* new example network: models a very large Ethernet LAN. Ini files
	  for old example networks available in test/ subdir.

	* sample application changed to EtherAppCli+EtherAppSrv. EtherAppCli
	  sends requests of at configurable intervals to EtherAppSrv.
	  Each request contains how many bytes EtherAppSrv should send back
	  in response. If this number is 0, no frames are sent; if it is
	  larger than ~1500, several frames are sent back.

	* Checkin of the Ethernet model. The Ethernet MAC model was written
	jointly with David Wu during my stay between February and October 2003
	at CTIE, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia, on the invitation
	of Dr. Ahmet Sekercioglu.

	If you are interested in the early history of the Ethernet code,
	change to the project root and type
