	Network Emulation feature no longer depends on OMNeT++ to detect the
	presence of PCAP. Instead the feature can be turned on/off by the user.

2015-03-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	Drop packet only when there's an error during serialization.

2015-02-23  Zoltan Bojthe

	ExtInterface uses the new serializers.

2015-03-30  Rudolf Hornig

	The HAVE_PCAP macro is no longer used. To use the emulation feature
	you have to install the libpcap-dev package, turn on the feature and
	rebuild INET. Running ./configure in the omnetpp root and make changes to
	inet/src/makefrag is no longer required.

	On Linux pcap is now configured to use immediate mode. This results in
	much better response times (sub ms ping responses over a local network)
	and reduces the CPU time required for the packet capturing. On Windows
	and MAC this API is not available so the interface still polls the
	card every 500us. This still gives sub ms accuracy, but requires a bit more
	CPU usage.

2015-02-05  Zoltan Bojthe

	Replaced getParentModule calls with module parameters.

2015-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	Applied C++ source code modernizer.

2014-12-12  Zoltan Bojthe

	ExtInterface fixes

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	and 500us on othe platforms. This allows getting much smaller response times when a
	component receives a packet from the outside world while maintaining relatively low CPU
	usage for polling.

2011-09-16  Zoltan Bojthe

	Identical changes in ExtInterface::initialize(int stage) function
	for more readability. In old code, stage 0 was in two code blocks.

2011-09-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixes for ev.disable_tracing

2011-09-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	bug #347: fix some compiler warnings.

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for cppcheck

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

	Ubuntu.

	change to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- INET/src/linklayer/ext
