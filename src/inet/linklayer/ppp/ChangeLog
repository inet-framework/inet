2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	a runtime error was thrown if no interface table was present in the host

	PPPInterface:
	- renamed netwIn, netwOut gates to upperLayerIn, upperLayerOut

2012-04-24  Tamas Borbely

	PPPInterface: compound modules are accepted as external queue
	module. The module must implement IOutputQueue, and the C++
	class of the simple module connected to the "out" gate must
	implement IPassiveQueue.

2012-04-13  Tamas Borbely

	Added optional ITrafficConditioner modules into the
	ingress and egress path of PPPInterface.

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2011-12-22  Andras Varga

	statistics of PPP revised:
	- lowercase names, consistent with other modules
	- record packet counts in a less confusing way: as rcvdPk:count instead
	  of packetBytes(rcvdPk):count or rcvdPkBytes:count; total bytes is now
	  recorded as rcvdPk:sum(packetBytes)

2011-12-08  Zoltan Bojthe

	PPPInterface:
	- use queueType="" to turn off external queue module (old setting was
	  queueType="NoQueue")
	- queue module is now conditional (not present if queueType="")

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	NEDDOC fixes

2011-08-15  Andras Varga

	Adapted units to recent OMNeT++ change: replaced Kbps,KB,MB,GB with
	kbps,KiB,MiB,GiB

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Zoltan Bojthe

	PPP bugfix: notified when datarate changed on channel

	changed!
	 It should update the interface entry.

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-05-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added plugin interfaces to the network layer to be able to add
	drop/duplicate modules, througput meters etc.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-02-03  Levente Meszaros

	Fix: code used obsolete display string tag to set connection line style
	(the correct one is "ls")

2011-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

2008-07-07  Andras Varga

	performance: only fire notifications if someone is listening

	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)
