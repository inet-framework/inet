2015-12-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Existing 802.11 MAC implementation deprecated:
	- folder "mac" was renamed to "oldmac"
	- Ieee80211Mac was renamed to Ieee80211OldMac

	The new, modular MAC implementation is now the default one.

2015-11-06  Zoltan Bojthe

	Frame name changes: "wlan-ack" to "ACK", etc.

2015-11-05  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed names of watches (in "edcCAF[i].numSent", replace "i"
	with actual numeric index)

2015-11-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	Change: don't draw a random number if computeBackoffPeriod() is called
	with msg==nullptr. Changes fingerprint, but does not affect model
	behavior.

2015-11-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	Removed classifier ("classifier" NED parameter is now unused), use
	nic.classifierType instead

2015-11-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	Change default access category to AC_BE ("defaultAC" parameter default
	value changed from 0 to 1)

2015-11-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added watch (slottime)

2015-11-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fix EDCA "backoff" variable initial value (false->true)

2015-11-02  Levente Meszaros

	802.11: Fixed incorrect destination state after receiving a WLAN ACK.

	The 'examples/adhoc/ieee80211' folder contains a simple example: a
	wireless host sends ping requests to another. The ping replies always
	arrived incorrectly after a zero length backoff period.

	The following happened in the MAC module which sends the ping replies:

	After the reception of the last WLAN ACK of the last ping reply the MAC
	changed to DEFER state. This started an incorrect DIFS period, then a
	backoff period, and since there was no frame in the queue, finally the
	MAC changed to IDLE state. At the end of this process the backoff counter
	was zero. When the next ping reply arrived from the higher layer the MAC
	incorrectly continued the remaining backoff period. Thus, the MAC module
	always sent out the ping replies after a zero length backoff period.

2015-10-15  ------ inet-3.1.0 released ------

2015-10-14  Andras Varga

	Bugfix: change maxQueueSize's meaning to per AC queue.
	Before, maxQueueSize referred to the total of the AC queue lengths, which
	could lead to wrong simulation results. (Supposed that the AC_BK and
	AC_BE queues themselves add up to maxQueueSize -- then the MAC no longer
	accepts packets from the external queue, effectively blocking AC_VI and
	AC_VO traffic)

2015-10-10  Andras Varga

	Removed external queue support, i.e. the mgmt submodule in the Nic no
	longer serves as a passive queue for the MAC. This changes the results
	of some example simulations (about 4 of ~50), because e.g. the max queue
	lengths were configured to different values for the mgmt queue and the
	internal queue, and also the mgmt queue never supported the
	prioritizeMulticast option that the MAC supports for the internal queue.

2015-10-12  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fix: the slot time was not always correctly chosen for the configured
	mode (i.e. modulation and coding scheme).

2015-06-22  ------ inet-3.0.0 released ------

2015-05-13  ------ inet-2.99.1 released ------

2015-03-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed LENGTH_DATAHDR to DATAFRAME_HEADER_MINLENGTH.

2015-03-19  Levente Meszaros

	Renamed the old Radio80211aControlInfo to Ieee80211ReceptionIndication.

2015-03-18  Levente Meszaros

	Transport: Added ITransportPacket interface to TCPSegment, UDPPacket, and
	SCTPMessage. This change allows generic handling of transport packets. For
	example, see TunLoopbackApp.

2015-02-11  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed packet length of 802.11 data frames.

2015-02-11  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added ST_DATA_WITH_QOS to 802.11 data frames.

2015-03-10  Levente Meszaros

	802.11 MAC: Fixed control frame mode. The specification requires the control
	frames to be sent with the slowest mandatory mode.

2015-02-25  Levente Meszaros

	Refactored the MAC class to work with the new 802.11 mode descriptor classes.
	Deleted obsolete Ieee80211DescriptorData, Ieee80211Descriptor classes.
	Replaced opMode field with Ieee80211ModeSet.
	Replaced various bitrate fields with Ieee80211Mode.

	Updated mac state machine diagram to reflect current state.
	Updated affected fingerprints.

2014-11-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixed memory management problems found by valgrind memcheck.

2014-11-07  ------ inet-2.99.0 released ------

2014-09-18  Andras Varga

	Moved all sources under the src/inet directory, so that all #include
	statements begin with "inet/". The motivation is to rule out potential
	filename clashes when multiple model frameworks are used together.

	HINT: You can use the "opp_githist" command in inet/_scripts to find
	all previous locations of the sources in this directory, and to view
	the full history in gitk. Normal invocations of gitk can only show
	file history back to the most recent move operation.

2014-07-30  Andras Varga

	Changes on the inet-3.x branch so far:

	Code formatting (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- using uncrustify, see _scripts/reformat/*
	- common style for header guards

	Namespace (Zoltan Bojthe, Zsolt Prontvai)
	- code has been moved into the inet namespace

	Init stages (Zoltan Bojthe, Andras Varga)
	- init stages: reorganized by layers

	Signals (Zoltan Bojthe)
	- replace INotifiable and NotificationBoard by signals for
	  publish/subscribe communication

	Logging (Zoltan Bojthe, Benjamin Seregi)
	- EV log statements revised and categorized: EV_ERROR, EV_WARN,
	  EV_INFO, EV_DETAIL, EV_DEBUG, EV_TRACE

	802.11: Fix WAITACK timeout computation

	The standard say that the node must wait a time sifs+slot+aPHY_RX_START_Delay after
	the transmission before the ack timeout, but, if after the reception of the
	timeout the radio status is in reception the node must wait until the end
	of the reception, with this modification the node set the ACK time out
	to the appropriate value but in the moment that the timeout is received
	if the radio is in recv status the node will set an additional timeout
	delay equal to the transmission of and ACK.

2013-07-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	- ieee 802.11 mac: optimizations: use SIMTIME_ZERO instead 0, use
	  simtime_t instead double
	- WifiMode: fixed return value calculation - uses float constants instead
	  integer
	- ieee802.11 MAC: logState(): optimised, spacing fixes in output format
	- fixed compiler warning: signed/unsigned comparison; moved function body
	to .cc

2013-05-15  Alfonso Ariza Quintana - takeover from INETMANET

	- fix: erroneous behaviour in Ieee802.11 mac (do not change
	  backoff if the retry counter is 0)

	- throws error on unhandled messages

2013-02-20  Andras Varga

	const fixes (in OMNeT++ 5.0, check_and_cast<> no longer silently
	discards const modifier)

	TODO maybe introduce a check_and_const_cast<> macro as shortcut for

	Fix uninitialized variable.

2011-06-09  Rudolf Hornig

	Added support to handle multicast adresses in the Ieee80211 mac layers
	(#339). It behaves exactly like the broadcast address.

	Broadcast is actually a specific case of a multicast address.

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-28  Andras Varga

	packetSentToLower, packetReceivedFromLower, packetSentToUpper,
	packetReceivedFromUpper; data type is cPacket*.

2011-05-11  Andras Varga

	Compile fixes for MSVC

	- disambiguate arg types for pow(), sqrt(), etc. (ambiguity caused
	compile errors)
	- added implementations for missing C99 functions
	- MSVC does not have <stdint.h>, but most of its declarations are
	already provided by <omnetpp.h>

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

	Another 802.11 MAC model (from MF-1.0) had already existed and was
