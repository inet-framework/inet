	Replaced sequence number comparisons with operator<.
	Simplified loops by relying on the wrap around nature of SequenceNumber.
	Removed explicit modulo 4096 operations, because it's done automatically by the underlying SequenceNumber struct.

2018-12-19  Levente Mészáros

	Replaced variable and argument types for sequence number from int to SequenceNumber.

2018-12-14  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed block ack reordering receive buffer for duplicates.

	A packet was added to the buffer as many times as it was received. This
	is clearly superfluous (FCS is already checked, so they must be
	identical) and the duplicate leaked memory.

	Updated fingerprints.

2018-12-13  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed invalid sequence number error when block ack is used.

	The incorrect valid range parameter for isSequenceNumberLess caused some
	frame to be dropped before it was actually passed up.

2018-12-03  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed block ack mechanism, fixed clearing obsolete state for passed up frames.
	Extended frame removal to drop frames up to a sequence number.
	Added block ack agreement parameter to a few functions.
