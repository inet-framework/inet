	Separated SequenceNumber from SequenceNumberCyclic.

	The former is used in std::map keys where transitive ordering is a
	requirement. The latter is used where the protocol logic requires modulo
	arithmetic.

	Replaced sequence number comparisons with operator<.
	Simplified loops by relying on the wrap around nature of SequenceNumber.
	Removed explicit modulo 4096 operations, because it's done automatically by the underlying SequenceNumber struct.

2018-12-19  Levente Mészáros

	Replaced variable and argument types for sequence number from int to SequenceNumber.

	Fixed block ack reordering receive buffer for duplicates.

	A packet was added to the buffer as many times as it was received. This
	is clearly superfluous (FCS is already checked, so they must be
	identical) and the duplicate leaked memory.

	Updated fingerprints.

2018-12-13  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed invalid sequence number error when block ack is used.

	The incorrect valid range parameter for isSequenceNumberLess caused some
	frame to be dropped before it was actually passed up.

2018-12-03  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed block ack mechanism, fixed clearing obsolete state for passed up frames.
	Extended frame removal to drop frames up to a sequence number.
	Added block ack agreement parameter to a few functions.

	Renaming:
	    MACAddress -> MacAddress

2017-11-16  ------ inet-3.99.1 released ------

2017-05-11  Levente Mészáros

	Renamed frame variables to header where applicable.

2017-05-10  Levente Mészáros

	Renamed MAC header arguments to *Header.

2017-05-09  Levente Mészáros

	Renamed multiple header chunks.

	Ieee80211DataFrame -> Ieee80211DataHeader
	Ieee80211DataOrMgmtFrame -> Ieee80211DataOrMgmtHeader
	Ieee80211ManagementHeader -> Ieee80211MgmtHeader
	Ieee80211ManagementFrame -> Ieee80211MgmtFrame

2017-04-20  Levente Mészáros

	Refactored to use the new Packet API.
