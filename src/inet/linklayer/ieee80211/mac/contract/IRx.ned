// Interface for Rx processes. The Rx process checks received frames for
// errors, manages the NAV, and notifies Tx processes about the channel state
// (free or busy). The channel is free only if it is free according to both
// the physical (CCA) and the virtual (NAV-based) carrier sense algorithms.
// Correctly received frames are sent up to UpperMac (see IUpperMac), corrupted
// frames are discarded. Tx processes are also notified about corrupted and
// correctly received frames. so they can switch between using DIFS/AIFS and EIFS
// according to the channel access procedure.
