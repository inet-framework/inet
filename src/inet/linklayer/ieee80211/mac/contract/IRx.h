 * Abstract interface for Rx processes. The Rx process checks received frames for
 * errors, manages the NAV, and notifies Tx processes about the channel state
 * (free or busy). The channel is free only if it is free according to both
 * the physical (CCA) and the virtual (NAV-based) carrier sense algorithms.
 * Correctly received frames are sent up to UpperMac (see IUpperMac), corrupted
 * frames are discarded. Tx processes are also notified about corrupted and
 * correctly received frames. so they can switch between using DIFS/AIFS and EIFS
 * according to the channel access procedure.
