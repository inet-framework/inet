/**
 * Abstract interface for processes that implement contention-based channel access.
 * For each frame, Contention listens on the channel for a DIFS (AIFS) period
 * then for a random backoff period before transmitting the frame, and defers when
 * busy channel is sensed. After receiving a corrupted frame, EIFS is used instead
 * of the original DIFS (AIFS).
 *
 * Note that waiting for an ACK (or CTS) and initiating the retransmission if
 * it does not arrive is not handled by this process. Instead, that is typically
 * performed by a frame exchange class INET_API inside UpperMac (see IFrameExchange, IUpperMac).
