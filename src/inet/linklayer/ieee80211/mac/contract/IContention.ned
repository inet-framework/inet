// Interface for modules that implement contention-based channel access.
// For each frame, Contention listens on the channel for a DIFS (AIFS) period
// then for a random backoff period before transitting the frame, and defers when
// busy channel is sensed. After receiving a corrupted frame, EIFS is used instead
// of the original DIFS (AIFS).
