	Folder renamed from "newmac" to "mac"

2015-12-07  Andras Varga

	CollisionController was rewritten to use per-AC timers, to make its
	operation easier to follow in the IDE's Sequence Chart Tool.

	Existing collision controller (that used a single timer) was renamed
	to OptimizedCollisionController.

2015-12-09  Andras Varga

	Architecture change: all frame transmissions now go via a Tx, and
	ContentionTx only does contention. (ContentionTx was also renamed
	to plain Contention.)

2015-11-03  Andras Varga

	Fix: frames we transmit should set the NAV too (to prevent
	one AC from transmitting while another AC owns the channel)

2015-10-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	UpperMac: added parameters: fragmenterClass, reassemblyClass

2015-10-28  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fix: MAC queue length limit should not apply to management frames.

	This fixes the following bug: under heavy load, APs were unable to send
	out beacon frames. Beacon frames generated in the Mgmt module were
	discarded in the MAC because the queue was completely filled with data
	frames.

2015-10-22  Andras Varga

	BasicFragmentation rewritten; BasicReassembly edited

2015-10-22  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added fragmentation support

2015-10-22  Benjamin Seregi

	Added Onoe, ARF, AARF rate control algorithms

2015-10-16  Andras Varga

	Added rate selection and rate control support: IRateSelection,
	IRateControl, IStatistics

2015-12-04  Andras Varga

	Implemented early Ack timeout.

	Ack timeout should expire when reception of Ack is supposed to begin.
	When it does, we check whether a frame reception is in progress, and if
	not, we immediately retransmit. Otherwise, we wait until the whole frame
	has arrived (whether it was correctly received or not), and retransmit if
	it was NOT an Ack.

	Model added to master. In this initial form, it has roughly the same
	set of 802.11 features as the old Ieee80211Mac module: basic DCF and
	EDCA, with the channel access and some more parameters being
	configurable.

	How to switch to using the new MAC? Currently the old Ieee80211Mac is
	used by simulations, but Ieee80211Nic has been changed to make the type
	of the mac submodule configurable, via the new macType parameter.
	Thus, you only need to add the following line to your omnetpp.ini:

	**.macType = "Ieee80211CompatibleNewMac"

	Ieee80211CompatibleNewMac is a wrapper around Ieee80211NewMac to make
	its parameterization similar to the old MAC.

	NOTE THAT THE MAC IS NOW A COMPOUND MODULE. You can double-click on the
	mac submodule (in Tkenv) and expore its internals.

	Known issues (short-term TODO items):
	- No early ACK timeout, i.e. it only retransmits when the ACK has not
	  been fully received by the time it should have.
	- It uses EIFS instead of DIFS/AIFS too often. This is a limitation of
	  the 802.11 radio module: when it hears two frames that start at the
	  same time, it reports a corrupted frame, whereas it should interpret
	  that as just noise (as already the preamble and the PLCP header are
	  garbled).
	- Lifecycle events (shutdown, restart, crash) not supported yet.
	- It does not record as much statistics as the old model yet.

	Prominently missing features:
	- fragmentation, block acknowledgement, aggregation, frame rate selection

	The design was presented at the 2nd OMNeT++ Community Summit (Sept 3-4
	2015 at IBM Research, Zurich, Switzerland), and details discussed with
	several members of the community both in the Q&A session and informally.

	A revised and updated version of the presentation slides has been checked
	into the repo with the sources, as an odp document.

	Started development of a new 802.11 MAC model from scratch. The motiva-
	tion for starting over was that the old MAC dating back 2006 has been
	implemented largely as a single monolithic class that has accumulated
	so many features and accidental complexity over the years that the code
	has become very difficult to reason about and maintain, and it has become
	almost impossible to implement newer 802.11 features in it such as
	aggregation, various flavours of block acknowledgement, or HCCA mode.

	The goal of the development is to have a modular design, where
	components can be swapped in and out. Concepts such as contention-based
	channel access, frame exchange sequences, EDCA queues, aggregation,
	fragmentation, duplicate detection, block acknowledgement, frame rate
	selection, automatic rate selection, etc would be expressed as self-
	contained C++ classes that implement abstract interfaces and (may)
	have multiple implementations.

	This kind of modular design also favours the open-source development
	model, because abstract interfaces tend to give contributors better cues
	on where to start implementing a new feature, and new classes can
	be more readily accepted into the codebase because changes to existing
	code (and thus the risk of introducing new bugs) can be minimized.

	The starting point of the development was the old 802.11 MAC cca ~2006,
	before EDCA and other features were added. The code was heavily
	componentized, and nearly all of it was rewritten from scratch in the
	process. During the development we found that some components are
	better expressed as submodules of the main MAC module (communicating
	by C++ calls not messages), as it makes model structure more obvious
	to an observer, and also lets different implementations of the
	component have different parameterization.

	It is only the MAC that been replaced with new code. Other parts have
	been reused in near intact form: 802.11 frame formats, 802.11 radio
	implementation, descriptions of PHY modes, mgmt modules, etc.
