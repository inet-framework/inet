In @module-var-list.txt there are several OMNeT++ classes implementing a module listed. 

REMOVE all method variables that:
- that are configuration
- that are not changing during the runtime (i.e. they are just initialized)
- that are pointers or references to other modules or classes
- has type of simsignal_t

KEEP variables that:
- represent addresses or IDs
-  refer to Queues or data tables
-  represent counters
- represent states (i.e. enums)

For each remaining variables, update their description in th file
- For each variable assign a single letter code which is UNIQUE in that class
- Keep the one letter code consistent across modules if possible
- format: type name - assigned code
