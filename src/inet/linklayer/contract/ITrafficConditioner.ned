//
// This is the interface of traffic conditioner modules.
//
// Traffic conditioners implement the policing and shaping actions
// of a Diffserv router. They should be added to the input
// or output path of interface modules of routers at the
// edge of the Diffserv Domain.
//
// Traffic conditioners perform the following actions:
//  - classify the incoming packets
//  - meter the traffic in each class
//  - marks/drops packets depending on the result of metering
//  - shape the traffic to conform to the desired traffic profile
//
// They can be implemented as a compound module, using the classifier,
// meter, and marker modules defined in this package.
//
// See RFC 3290 for a detailed desciption of the architecture of traffic
// conditioners.
