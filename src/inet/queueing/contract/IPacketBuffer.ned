//
// Interface for packet buffer modules. A packet
// buffer is often used by packet queues to store packets in a limited shared
// resource. Packets can be added to and removed from a packet buffer. When the
// buffer becomes overloaded, one or more packets are dropped according to the
// configured dropping strategy. For each dropped packet, the packet owner is
// notified in order to update its internal state.
