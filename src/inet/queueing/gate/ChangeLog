	CreditBasedGate: Changed scheduling the change timer to allow scheduling
	for the current simulation time.

	Due to the recent change of the guard condition, the currentCredit and
	transmitCreditLimit are always different. The changeTime can be zero if
	the difference is very small and the gain rate is very large.

2023-05-02  Levente Mészáros

	queueing: Added a bit more logging.

2023-05-05  Levente Mészáros

	CreditBasedGate: There's no need to schedule the change timer when
	processing it.

	When the change timer is processed, currentCredit equals to
	transmitCreditLimit, so its impossible to reach it again with any gain
	rate.

2023-05-05  Levente Mészáros

	CreditBasedGate: Changed scheduleChangeTimer() to cancel the timer event
	if the transmitCreditLimit is unreachable.

	It used to do the changeTime calculation for these cases.

2023-05-02  Levente Mészáros

	CreditBasedGate: Extracted udpateGateState method.

	Previously the gate state update could trigger a sequence of operations
	in other modules that came back to the CreditBasedGate while it was in a
	middle of an operation. The gate state should be the last operation that
	is done by this module.

	This patch fixes issue #886.

2023-04-04  ------ inet-4.5.0 released ------

2023-03-22  Levente Mészáros

	CreditBasedGate: Changed setter methods to do nothing if the new value equals with the current.
	CreditBasedGate: Refactored interpacketgap handling.

2023-03-21  Levente Mészáros

	CreditBasedGate: Removed base class field initialization.
	CreditBasedGate: Extracted updateCurrentState() method.

2023-03-20  Levente Mészáros

	CreditBasedGate: Moved gate open/close to setCurrentCredit().
	CreditBasedGate: Added setCurrentCredit/setCurrentCreditGainRate methods to log activity.
	PeriodicGate: Added guardBandStateChanged signal and guardBandState statistic.

2023-03-16  Levente Mészáros

	CreditBasedGate: Changed to not accumulate credits during the guard band period of the connected periodic gate.

2023-03-16  Zoltan Bojthe

	PeriodicGate: Added parameter test: check duration values larger than 0.
	PeriodicGate: Optimized read durations NED parameter to clocktime_t vector and use it
	PeriodicGate: Optimized getInitiallyOpen() returns the stored value instead of rereading NED parameter.
	PeriodicGate: Removed unnecessary 0 duration value processing.
	PeriodicGate: Fixed offset processing in initializeGating(): when offset positioning to a duration
	border, choose the next state with 0 offset. -

2023-03-10  Levente Mészáros

	PeriodicGate: Changed initializeGating to allow the initialOffset to be greater than the total duration.

2023-03-10  Levente Mészáros

	PeriodicGate: Reverted back to the behavior where parameter changes are instantly followed by initializeGating.
	Removed name != nullptr checks from handleParameterChange.

2023-03-08  Zoltan Bojthe

	PeriodicGate: Fixed rescheduling changeTimer.

2023-03-08  Levente Mészáros

	PeriodicGate: Separated the scheduling priority parameter for open and close events.
	PeriodicGate: Changed to a more strict gating initalization method.
	PeriodicGate: The canPacketFlowThrough method already assumes the gate is open.

2023-01-24  Julian Oertel

	CreditBasedGate: Credit updates on closed transmission gate, step 1.

	This change addresses the issue that the credit of CreditBasedGates was
	increasing on while the corresponding PeriodicGate was closed. Per IEEE
	802.Q-2018 credit should be frozen on closed gates.

2023-03-06  Levente Mészáros

	GateControlList: Changed setting PeriodicGate parameters to go through cPar instead of directly accessing the fields.
	GateControlList: Fixed buffer overflow.

2023-03-06  JiashuoLin

	PeriodicGate: Added a parameter to configure whether the implicit guard band feature is enabled.
	Added GateControlList, a module which accepts parameters in GCL format and configures the corresponding PeriodicGate modules.

2023-02-21  Levente Mészáros

	PeriodicGate: Fixed #822 as suggested by Manuel Eppler.

2022-11-08  Levente Mészáros

	PeriodicGate: Added changeTimerSchedulingPriority parameter to allow
	controlling the order of open/close operations in a submodule gate vector.

2022-09-26  Andras Varga

	Eliminated static buffer from resolveDirective() by changing return type to std::string.

2022-05-13  ------ inet-4.4.0 released ------

2022-03-10  Levente Mészáros

	PeriodicGate: Fixed scheduling change timer, it must come after it has been already processed.

2022-03-03  Levente Mészáros

	PeriodicGate: Fixed unnecessary state change when the last duration is 0 (due to even length requirement).

2022-02-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added missing INET_WITH_PHYSICALLAYERWIRELESSCOMMON
	Moved interpacketGapStartedSignal/interpacketGapEndedSignal to Simsignals.h.

2022-02-15  Levente Mészáros

2021-10-18  Levente Mészáros

	Refactored statistics of gate modules.

2021-06-14  Levente Mészáros

	Added a new InteractiveGate module that allows the user to explicitly
	control the gate open/closed state.

2021-05-04  Levente Mészáros

	PeriodicGate: Replaced getTotalLength with getDataLength because popped
	parts should be ignored.

2021-04-29  Levente Mészáros

	PeriodicGate: Fixed condition when no change is scheduled, i.e. the gate
	is open indefinitly.

2021-05-04  Levente Mészáros

	PeriodicGate: Changed duration parameter type to object (array).

2021-03-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	Changed if-else-if ladders in initialize() to separate if statements because
	different stages may have the same number.
