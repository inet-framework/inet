	Added a new queueing package which replaces the old queue package. This new
	package comes with a different API and a lot of new components. All old queue
	components were either ported or completely replaced with components of the new
	queueing package.

	Added new functional extension support classes: CPacketClassifierFunction,
	CPacketComparatorFunction, CPacketDropperFunction, CPacketFilterFunction,
	and CPacketSchedulerFunction.
