//
// This module implements weighted round-robin scheduling.
//
// There is a weight associated with each input gate.
// Initially, each input gate gets as many tokens as their
// weight. When a packet is requested, then the first input
// gate is selected that has a packet and enough tokens,
// and one token is consumed. When there are waiting input
// packets, but there are not enough tokens to schedule one,
// then each token bucket is filled up.
