2022-04-11  Levente Mészáros

	Added missing destructors to fix errors repored by sanitizer tests.

2022-03-16  Rudolf Hornig

	Moved/removed GPL licensed code to a separate repo to make INET clean LGPL licensed.

2022-03-04  Levente Mészáros

	Changed packetPush to make sure that there are no hazards in the queueLength statistics.

	There are two problems here: packets can be dropped due to the queue
	being overloaded, packets can also be pulled out immediately as they get
	pushed into the queue. Depending on the order of push, remove, pull
	operations the queue length can go above capacity and also below zero,
	both of which should be avoided.

2022-01-17  Marcin Bosk

	Added initial HTB code.

	CompoundPacketQueueBase: Removed check for packetDropperFunction.

	It's allowed not to have a packeDropperFunction and some capacity limit
	to be configured. In this case the queue is supposed to generate back
	pressure towards its source.

2021-12-10  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed queueBitLength statistic hazard caused by adding new packet length
	earlier than removing dropped packet length.

2021-12-09  Levente Mészáros

	Renamed signals to packet*Started and packet*Ended.

2021-12-06  Levente Mészáros

	CompoundPacketQueueBase: Fixed queue length hazard when the statistic goes
	above the capacity limit.
	Added packetPushCompletedSignal and changed queueLength to use it. This
	swaps the order of packetDropped and packetPushCompleted signals
	effectively fixing the bug.
	CompoundPacketQueueBase: Eliminated unused signal subscriptions.
	CompoundPacketQueueBase: Added the same dropping behavior to compound packet
	queues that is already present in simple ones.
	CompoundPacketQueueBase: Replaced packetPushedSignal with packetPushInitiatedSignal.
	PacketQueue: Simplified the handling of queue overload.
	The queue must be not overloaded when packetPush is complete.
	PacketQueue: Fixed queue length hazard when the statistic goes above the capacity limit.
	Added packetPushCompletedSignal and changed queueLength to use it. This
	swaps the order of packetDropped and packetPushCompleted signals
	effectively fixing the bug.
	PacketQueue: Replaced packetPushedSignal with packetPushInitiatedSignal.
	PacketQueue: Added more documentation for various parameters.

2021-11-02  Levente Mészáros

	Removed shared packet buffer from priority queues by default.

2021-10-18  Levente Mészáros

	Refactored statistics of packet queues and packet buffers.

2021-10-05  Levente Mészáros

	PacketQueue: Added flowQueueingTime statistic.
	Added various throughput statistics to PacketQueue, PacketFilterBase and PacketFlowBase.

2021-09-28  Levente Mészáros

	Added packet time argument values for increaseTimeTag calls.

2021-09-15  Levente Mészáros

	CompoundPacketQueueBase: Added missing canPull*Packet methods.

2021-09-14  Levente Mészáros

	Implemented recently added removeAllPackets method in IPacketCollection subclasses.

2021-05-07  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added parent or this to parameter access for OMNeT++ 6 compatibility.

2021-04-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added/updated Enter_Method() info to the signalname in receiveSignal().

2021-03-23  Levente Mészáros

	GatingPriorityQueue: Added support for guard band by passing down bitrate.

2021-03-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	Changed if-else-if ladders in initialize() to separate if statements because
	different stages may have the same number.

2021-01-11  ------ inet-4.3.0 released ------

2020-12-08  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed leaks detected by Valgrind.

2020-11-10  Levente Mészáros

	Moved InProgressQueue to queueing/queue folder.
	Renamed SelectiveQueue to GatingPriorityQueue.
	Renamed CompoundPacketQueue source files to CompoundPacketQueueBase.

2020-08-25  Levente Mészáros

	Adapted to new EV_FIELD macro.

2020-08-04  Levente Mészáros

	Added OmittedPacketQueue module.

2020-07-24  Levente Mészáros

	Renamed several functions related to the word pop for consistency.

2020-07-20  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed warmup period for compound source expressions, see bug #549.

2020-05-19  Levente Mészáros

	Added packet event insertion to PacketQueue.

2020-04-23  Levente Mészáros

	Added SelectiveQueue, a priority queue with packet gates for each internal queue.

2020-04-17  Levente Mészáros

	Fixed missing take() calls in pushPacket.

2020-04-09  Levente Mészáros

	Implemented enqueuePacket/dequeuePacket with PacketQueueBase.
	Added InProgressQueue.

2020-04-08  Levente Mészáros

	Moved taking packet ownership from protected base class method to public methods.

2020-02-18  Levente Mészáros

	Added @defaultStatistic for a few modules.

2020-01-08  ------ inet-4.2.0 released ------

2018-10-03  Levente Mészáros

	Added a new queueing package which replaces the old queue package. This new
	package comes with a different API and a lot of new components. All old queue
	components were either ported or completely replaced with components of the new
	queueing package.

	Added new NED simple modules: DropHeadQueue, DropTailQueue, and PacketQueue.
	Added new NED compound modules: CompoundPacketQueue, PriorityQueue, and RedMarkerQueue.
