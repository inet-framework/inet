2013-08-22  ------ inet-2.2.0 released ------

2013-07-29  Zoltan Bojthe

	MACBase and it descendants: added clearQueue() for clear outgoing queue
	at CRASH operation

2013-04-27  Andras Varga

	InterfaceTable, RoutingTable: added lifecycle support

2013-04-09  Andras Varga

	introduced MACBase (INotifiable and ILifecycle), all MACs
	adapted to it

	Details:
	- introduce isOperational etc in MACs
	- remove hasSubscribers optimization from PPP, we'll use signals soon
	anyway

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-04-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	PPP: bugfix: use the interface table only if it exists
	a runtime error was thrown if no interface table was present in the host

	PPPInterface:
	- renamed netwIn, netwOut gates to upperLayerIn, upperLayerOut

2012-04-24  Tamas Borbely

	PPPInterface: compound modules are accepted as external queue
	module. The module must implement IOutputQueue, and the C++
	class of the simple module connected to the "out" gate must
	implement IPassiveQueue.

2012-04-13  Tamas Borbely

	Added optional ITrafficConditioner modules into the
	ingress and egress path of PPPInterface.

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2011-12-22  Andras Varga

	statistics of PPP revised:
	- lowercase names, consistent with other modules
	- record packet counts in a less confusing way: as rcvdPk:count instead
	  of packetBytes(rcvdPk):count or rcvdPkBytes:count; total bytes is now
	  recorded as rcvdPk:sum(packetBytes)

2011-12-08  Zoltan Bojthe

	PPPInterface:
	- use queueType="" to turn off external queue module (old setting was
	  queueType="NoQueue")
	- queue module is now conditional (not present if queueType="")

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	NEDDOC fixes

2011-08-15  Andras Varga

	Adapted units to recent OMNeT++ change: replaced Kbps,KB,MB,GB with
	kbps,KiB,MiB,GiB

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Zoltan Bojthe

	PPP bugfix: notified when datarate changed on channel

	bug was the next:
	 FIXME: The module does not notice if the datarate of the channel
	changed!
	 It should update the interface entry.

	also some code style changes

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-05-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	added the following signals for use with the new PcapRecorder:
	packetSentToLower, packetReceivedFromLower, packetSentToUpper,
	packetReceivedFromUpper; data type is cPacket*.

2011-05-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	PPPInterface: change txQueueLimit value when use internal queue

2011-05-13  Zoltan Bojthe

2011-04-27  Tamas Borbely

	fix PPP signals (rxPkBytesOk and passedUpPkBytes)

2011-04-12  Rudolf Hornig

	Refactoring in Ethernet and PPP interfaces. NoQueue can be used also as
	queueType parameter. Added support for input and output hooks in NICs.

2011-03-22  Zoltan Bojthe

	changes simsignal_t variables to static member

	also some codestyle changes, include changes

	Renamed IPlugin -> IHook

2010-11-22  Rudolf Hornig

	Added plugin interfaces to the network layer to be able to add
	drop/duplicate modules, througput meters etc.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-02-03  Levente Meszaros

	Fix: code used obsolete display string tag to set connection line style
	(the correct one is "ls")

2011-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	- refreshOutGateConnection called bad parameter, when gate connected

2008-07-26  Andras Varga

	refactored to use cGate::getDatarateChannel()

2008-07-07  Andras Varga

	performance: only fire notifications if someone is listening

	performance: remember output gate pointer instead of looking up
	gate by name for each send()

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-07-14  Andras Varga

	PPPModule renamed to PPP

2004-04-26  Andras Varga

	Initial version of the PPP model.

	If you are interested in the early history of the PPP code,
	change to the project root and type
