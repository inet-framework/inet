	STP: added switch-related STP/RSTP config parameters.

2013-10-28  Benmartin92

	EtherSwitch, IEEE8021DRelay: changed to work with scenarios without STP.

2013-10-24  Benmartin92

	EtherSwitch: EtherSwitch now supports Spanning Tree algorithm.

	ISpanningTree: moduleinterface added to supports different versions of
	Spanning Tree protocols.

	SpanningTree: module renamed to "STP", this abbreviation refer to the
	protocol described in IEEE 802.1D-1998.
	STPTester and IEEE8021DInterfaceData moved to ieee8021d folder.

2013-10-17  Benmartin92

	IEEE8021DRelay: module added. This relay module is intended to work with
	both STP and RSTP. IEEE8021DBPDU: BPDU message added for RSTP/STP.

	STP: added IEEE 802.1D-1998 implementation of Spanning Tree Protocol.
	The source code is based on ANSA (https://github.com/kvetak/ANSA)
	implementation.

	RSTP: added IEEE 802.1D-2004 implementation of Spanning Tree Protocol.
	The source code is based on Juan Luis Garrote Molinero's implementation
	from INETMANET

	IEEE8021DInterfaceData: InterfaceEntry is extended with IEEE8021DInterfaceData.
	It is created to contain additional port interface information of an
	EtherSwitch (e.g. is the port forwarding or not?).

	added vlan code from inetmanet - 2996f0d703dc47b54d6262ae18b60f7a9e3e9757
