    * EtherMAC2: refactored to use cGate::getDatarateChannel()

2008-07-07  Andras Varga

    * removed utils.h/cc: no longer needed with OMNeT++ 4.0 (which has
      built-in message IDs, message tree IDs and sequence chart
      visualization)

    * EtherMAC2: performance: only fire notifications if someone is listening

    * EtherMAC2: made notification consistent with PPP: use TxDetails as
      "details" object

    * EtherMAC, EtherMAC2: performance: remember output gate pointer
      instead of looking it up for each send()

    * moved class declarations from .cc files into separate .h files
      for EtherHub, EtherLLC, EtherEncap, etc

    * created EtherMAC2, which is a simplified, duplex-only version of
      EtherMAC (i.e. it does not contain the CSMA/CD algorithm)

    * EtherMAC: auto MAC address assignment

    * EtherMAC: auto-configuration of transmission rate and duplex/half duplex i
      mode.

    * it's no longer an error if EtherMAC is not connected to the network
      ("unplugged cable")

    * elaboration of Ethernet frame types: Ethernet II, 802.3 with LLC,
      802.3 with LLC and SNAP.

    * added EtherEncap, which does encapsulation/decapsulation with
      Ethernet II frames.

    * communication between LLC and higher layers changed: now it uses
      controlInfo() as introduced in OMNeT++ 3.0

    * PAUSE handling fixed: PAUSE frames to be sent have now priority
      in the MAC (they overtake normal frames in the queue).
      MACRelayUnits: minimal time interval introduced that must elapse
      before sending another PAUSE frame.

    * new example network: models a very large Ethernet LAN. Ini files
      for old example networks available in test/ subdir.

    * sample application changed to EtherAppCli+EtherAppSrv. EtherAppCli
      sends requests of at configurable intervals to EtherAppSrv.
      Each request contains how many bytes EtherAppSrv should send back
      in response. If this number is 0, no frames are sent; if it is
      larger than ~1500, several frames are sent back.

    * Various fixes on the switch model:
    - address table reading was broken
    - fixed bug in MACRelayUnitNP and PP (referencing a deleted message)
    - fixed crash at removing aged entries from table
    - zero addressTableSize to mean unlimited table
    - table management: if table full, throw out oldest entry
