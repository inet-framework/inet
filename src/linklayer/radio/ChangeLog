2012-08-27  Zoltan Bojthe

	Bugfix for radio ModulationType: modulationClass member was uninitialized.

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-02-11  Rudolf Hornig

	Takeover from INETMANET @ fff5dfd

	Added support for configurable noise generators. It can be configured with
	the noiseGenerator parameter of the Radio.

	Airtime Link Metric support added to the radios. Can be turned on by the
	airtimeLinkComputation parameter

	Added support for configurable error models. It can be configured with
	the errorModel parameter of the Radio.

2011-12-21  Andras Varga

	Radio: statistics revised (titles changed to lower case; added "max"
	to places where "timeavg" was present and appropriate; etc)

2011-12-05  Andras Varga

	Follow PhyControlInfo method name spelling change

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-07-20  Levente Meszaros

	Renamed uppergateIn to upperLayerIn and uppergateOut to upperLayerOut.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-05-19  Rudolf Hornig

	Added a SPEED_OF_LIGHT global constant in INETDefs.h

2011-05-19  Rudolf Hornig

	Original channel controller modified to work with radios instead of
	hosts. Channel controller extended is removed.

2011-05-17  Rudolf Hornig

	Channel comntrol and ChannelControlExtended is merged and become
	ChannelCOntrolExtended. AirframeExtended is merged into AirFrame

2011-05-11  Andras Varga

	Compile fixes for MSVC

	- disambiguate arg types for pow(), sqrt(), etc. (ambiguity caused
	  compile errors)
	- added implementations for missing C99 functions
	- MSVC does not have <stdint.h>, but most of its declarations are
	  already provided by <omnetpp.h>

2011-05-06  Zoltan Bojthe

	Mobility made independent of ChannelControl

	- moved ChannelControl* to world/radio

	- merged ChannelAccessExtended to ChannelAccess

	- host registration was moved from Mobility to the radio modules.
	 (There can be multiple radios per host, so ChannelControlExtended
	 now maintains a registration count for each host.)
	 Mobility now doesn't refer to ChannelControl at all, so one can
	 create mobile networks that don't contain ChannelControl at all;
	 ChannelControl is only needed for radio communication.

	- global playgroundSizeX/Y parameters have been replaced with
	 per-mobility constraintAreaX/Y, constraintAreaWidth/Height
	 parameters for most mobility modules
	 NOTE: Playground is now conceptionally unlimited, only the
	 movement of individual nodes are (can be) constrained to
	 rectangular areas. (This change was needed because mobility
	 modules now don't access ChannelControl that used to contain
	 the playgroundSizeX/Y parameters.)

	- x,y parameters have been renamed to initialX/Y; a new
	 initFromDisplayString parameter controls whether the initial
	 coordinates come from the display string or from the parameters
	 (for most modules; some mobility modules don't have these parameters)

	Example simulations are updated in a separate commit.

2011-04-18  Andras Varga

	compile fix for MSVC

	MSVC has no <stdint.h>, but the types it defines are already in
	<omnetpp.h>

2011-04-07  Rudolf Hornig

	Simplifications in radio Ieee80211module. Added multiradio example.

2011-04-05 Rudolf Hornig

	* Refactored the radio framework. The AbstractRadioExtended has been renamed to
	  Radio. PropagationModel is now configured globally in the channel controller.
	  RadioModel is configurable via a parameter instead of overriding a virtual
	  factory method. GenericRadio.cc/.h and Ieee80211.cc/.h is removed as it is no longer
	  needed.

2011-03-31  Rudolf Hornig

	Migrated the propagation models from INETMANET.

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2010-04-26  Andras Varga

	* PathLossReceptionModel.h/cc, Ieee80211Radio.ned: checked in shadowing
	component patch from Nikos Simantirakis (simantirakis@rt-solutions.de).
	"It implements a shadowing component for the path loss reception model.
	This random variable has a normal distribution in dB and results to
	log-normal distribution in mW. This is a widespread and common model
	used for reproducing shadowing effects (Rappaport, T. S. (2002),
	Wireless Communications - Principles and Practice, Prentice Hall PTR)."

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2006-09-11  Andras Varga

	Further refactoring [commits marked as tuexen, due to svn client
	misconfiguration]

2006-09-05  Andras Varga

	Added GenericRadio, IModulation, and Modulation (code based on the
	Mobility Framework) [commits marked as tuexen, due to svn client
	misconfiguration]

2006-09-02  Andras Varga

	* code moved out into NetworkInterfaces/Radio
	* Radio turned into an abstract base class, AbstractRadio
	* added IRadioModel and IReceptionModel as ways to abstract away the
	  characteristics of the radio receiver and the channel propagation.
	* added the Ieee80211Radio module as a concrete subclass of AbstractRadio
	* added Ieee80211Radio and PathLossReceptionModel
	[commits marked as tuexen, due to svn client misconfiguration]

2006-09-01  Andras Varga

	Initial version of the Radio module, checked in under
	NetworkInterfaces/MF80211/phyLayer/snrEval. [commits marked as tuexen,
	due to svn client misconfiguration]

	If you are interested in the early history of the Radio code,
	change to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- INET/src/linklayer/radio INET/src/networkinterfaces/radio \
