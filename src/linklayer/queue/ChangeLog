	Old queuing components has been removed:
	 - DropTailQosQueue
	 - REDQueue
	 - WeightedFairQueue
	 - IQoSClassifier (moved to linklayer/ieee80211/mac)
	 - BasicDSCPClassifier
	Some of them can be substituted by compound modules composed
	of these newly added components:
	 - FIFOQueue
	 - REDDropper
	 - ThresholdDropper
	 - PriorityScheduler
	 - WRRScheduler
	For example REDQueue is a combination of a REDDropper and a FIFOQueue,
	and DropTailQosQueue is a combination of some classifier, DropTailQueues,
	and a PriorityScheduler.

	DropTailQueue: name of the inner queue can be specified by
	a parameter. This is useful when a compound module contains
	multiple queues, and you want to specify one of them in
	the 'q' tag of the display string.

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-02-10  Andras Varga

	added WeigthedFairQueue from INETMANET (following some formatting and
	C++ improvements)

2011-12-22  Andras Varga

	statistics revised:

	- added dropPk and queueingTime
	- changed statistics titles to lowercase
	- add "max" recording mode to places where "timeavg" was present and
	  it is appropriate
	- fix: interpolationmode should be used with @statistic and not with
	  @signal
	- remove "histogram" recording from queue length statistics (makes
	  no sense), added "timeavg" instead
	- removed "stats" where "histogram" was already present (as it implies
	  "stats")

2011-08-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	removed NoQueue (NICs now use queueType="" to select the internal queue)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	BasicDSCPClassifier: fix

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-04-12  Rudolf Hornig

	Refactoring in Ethernet and PPP interfaces. NoQueue can be used also as
	queueType parameter. Added support for input and output hooks in NICs.

2011-03-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	change simsignal_t member variables to static member

2011-03-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	Features: IPv4 - milestone 1

2011-03-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	features: TCP_NSC, TCP_lwip, IPv6 completed

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Interfaces renamed to start with I.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	removed obsolete and misleading !WORK_IN_PROGRESS! files

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	removed redundant (long) conversion from emit() calls

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	@statistic: added missing 'vector' recording mode

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	update for omnet++ 4.1b3:

	renamed @signal to @statistic modeHint= to record=

2010-06-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	convert statistics to use signals

2010-06-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Add isEmpty() functions to IPassiveQueue and its child classes

2010-06-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	indent changes - from Thomas Reschka

2009-07-19  Andras Varga

	added further module @labels (ethernet-node, wireless-node, mpls-node);
	added default icons to several module types

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-07-09  Andras Varga

	* all queue modules: performance: remember output gate pointer
	instead of looking up gate by name for each send()
