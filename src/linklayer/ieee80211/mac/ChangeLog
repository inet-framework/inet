2013-07-29  Zoltan Bojthe

	MACBase and it descendants: added clearQueue() for clear outgoing queue
	at CRASH operation

2013-07-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	- ieee 802.11 mac: optimizations: use SIMTIME_ZERO instead 0, use
	  simtime_t instead double
	- WifiMode: fixed return value calculation - uses float constants instead
	  integer
	- ieee802.11 MAC: logState(): optimised, spacing fixes in output format
	- fixed compiler warning: signed/unsigned comparison; moved function body
	to .cc

2013-05-15  Alfonso Ariza Quintana - takeover from INETMANET

	- fix: erroneous behaviour in Ieee802.11 mac (do not change
	  backoff if the retry counter is 0)
	- removed fixFSM parameter
	- changed the default MTU size to 2304bytes for 802.11 MAC

2013-04-09  Andras Varga

	Introduced MACBase (INotifiable and ILifecycle), all MACs
	adapted to it

2013-03-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	Ieee80211Mac: added signals, statistics

2013-03-12  Zoltan Bojthe

	linklayer: moved WirelessMacBase to common folder

	this class will be shared by:
	 - IdealWirelessMac module in src/linklayer/idealwireless
	 - Ieee80211Mac module in src/linklayer/ieee80211/mac

2013-03-01  Zoltan Bojthe

	WirelessMacBase: bugfixes

	- handleCommand() should handle only commands from upper layer
	- handleLowerMsg() should handle only packets from lower layer
	- throws error on unhandled messages

2013-02-20  Andras Varga

	const fixes (in OMNeT++ 5.0, check_and_cast<> no longer silently
	discards const modifier)

	TODO maybe introduce a check_and_const_cast<> macro as shortcut for
	const_cast<T*>(check_and_cast<const T*>(p)) ?

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

2012-08-28  Zoltan Bojthe

	- Better parameter processing: error is thrown if an undefined value
	  is specified in opmode or autoBitrate
	- Refactored how WifiModulationType::getMode80211a/b/g/p()
	  is used.
	- Added the Ieee80211Descriptor class to assign modulation speed
	  and type for the different opModes.

	Bugfix: Bitrate for opMode 'p' was incorrectly set.

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-02-11  Rudolf Hornig

	Added support to use the modulation parameters to determine
	slot, diffs and ack timeout. Set the useModulationParameters parameter
	for the MAC module.

	Added support to prioritize multicast frames. Set the
	prioritizeMulticast parameter for the MAC module.

	Added duplicate frame detection (turned on by default). Use
	duplicateDetectionFilter, purgeOldTuples and duplicateTimeOut
	parameters.

2011-12-22  Andras Varga

	EtherMAC: statistics titles changed to lower case; cosmetics

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-10  Andras Varga

	bug #398: Broadcast packets need to use the basic bitrate [ZBojthe]

	For 802.11s, the bit rate to send multicast frames is the minimum
	defined in the standard (1 Mbit/s).

2011-07-20  Levente Meszaros

	Renamed lowergateIn to lowerLayerIn and lowergateOut to lowerLayerOut.

2011-07-20  Levente Meszaros

	Renamed uppergateIn to upperLayerIn and uppergateOut to upperLayerOut.

2011-08-03  Zoltan Bojthe

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-07-19  Levente Meszaros

	Fix uninitialized variable.

2011-06-09  Rudolf Hornig

	Added support to handle multicast adresses in the Ieee80211 mac layers
	(#339). It behaves exactly like the broadcast address.

	Broadcast is actually a specific case of a multicast address.

2011-06-03  Rudolf Hornig

	Typo: Wify->Wifi

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-28  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: end-line spaces removed, using spaces.pl in OMNeT++.

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-05-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added the following signals for use with the new PcapRecorder:
	packetSentToLower, packetReceivedFromLower, packetSentToUpper,
	packetReceivedFromUpper; data type is cPacket*.

2011-05-11  Andras Varga

	Compile fixes for MSVC

	- disambiguate arg types for pow(), sqrt(), etc. (ambiguity caused
	compile errors)
	- added implementations for missing C99 functions
	- MSVC does not have <stdint.h>, but most of its declarations are
	already provided by <omnetpp.h>

2011-04-28  Rudolf Hornig

	Added Mesh network support to Ieee80211

2011-04-15  Rudolf Hornig

	Added new ieee802.11 model from INETMANET, supporting a,b,g,p modes.

2011-03-08  Rudolf Hornig

	mf80211 and iee80211 can be compiled separately

2011-03-08  Rudolf Hornig

	mf80211, ieee80211 and mobility feature

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2010-09-30  Andras Varga

	introduced a utility function for interface name creation

2009-07-16  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);

	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2007-01-18  Levente Meszaros

	* bugfixes and improvements on the MAC model

2006-05-04  Andras Varga

	Initial revision of the new MAC model written by Levente Meszaros.

	Another 802.11 MAC model (from MF-1.0) had already existed and was
	available in INET Framework at the time, but its code was not FSM-based
	and had several problems, so we decided to implement a new one
	from scratch.

	If you are interested in the early history of the 802.11 MAC code,
	change to the project root and type
