2012-08-04  Rudolf Hornig

	The "bitrate" parameter now has a default value: it is
	11Mbps for 802.11b, 27Mbps for 802.11p and 54Mbps for
	802.11g and 802.11a. (i.e. the default bitrate depends
	on the opMode parameter)

2012-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added new bitrate parameter to NIC. The Radio and MAC uses
	this parameter to set their own bitrate parameters.

2012-07-19  Zoltan Bojthe

	Bugfix for ieee80211:
	Packets in 'g' mode with 11Mbps or 12Mbps bitrates were
	using incorrect air time. Some calculations in 'b' mode
	was wrong too, because these sometimes also use table of
	'g' mode. Two values were swapped in the bitrate tables.

2012-06-29  Alfonso Ariza Quintana

	Implemented duplicate frame filtering in promiscuous mode.
	(Takeover from INETMANET)

	It is now possible to set the bitrate directly in PhyControlInfo
	so that the given frame will be transmitted with that bitrate
	independent of the MAC/Radio configuration.

	The convertToEther parameter morphed into encapDecap
	tri-state enum string parameter in access point management
	modules. Conversion of packets to/from higher layer depends:
	- "true": encapsulate/decapsulate
	- "false": no conversion
	- "eth": convert to/from EtherFrame

	Fixed issue where etherType was not set in Ieee802Ctrl
	when the management module decapsulated the message.

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------
	
2012-06-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Takover from INETMANET-2.0 @ 7fb431b (minor bugfixes)
	All files are synced. The following features were omitted:
	MULTIQUEUES, HWMP and MESH networking related code.

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-02-11  Rudolf Hornig

	Takeover from INETMANET @ fff5dfd

	ChangeLog for the mac, radio and mgmt for further details.

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-09-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	bug #361: Ieee80211MgmtSTA::initialize error

	The Ieee80211MgmtSTA needs to initialize at stage 1 because
	ChannelControl initializes numChannels at stage 0.

2011-11-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for bug #190 by Alfonso Ariza: 802.11 STA nodes abort the
	simulation

	If the STA node is not associated to an AP, it will send a packet with an
	invalid address to the mac and the mac will stop the simulation. It's
	necessary to modify the files Ieee80211STA.cc and Ieee80211STASimple.cc

	Copied changes from bugreport and from inetmanet.

	In Ieee80211MgmtSTA, I removed the old solution, and inserted new
	solution from manet.

2011-07-20  Levente Meszaros

	Renamed lowergateIn to lowerLayerIn and lowergateOut to lowerLayerOut.
	Renamed uppergateIn to upperLayerIn and uppergateOut to upperLayerOut.

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-04-28  Rudolf Hornig

	Added Mesh network support. Use Ieee80211NicMesh

2011-04-15  Rudolf Hornig

	Added new ieee802.11 model from INETMANET, supporting a,b,g,p modes.
	Use Ieee80211NewNic

2011-04-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Added support for optional submodules (Mgmt, hooks) in Ieee80211Nic.

2011-04-05  Rudolf Hornig

	Radio refactoring. Removed abstract baseclass. Instead of overriding
	virtual methods, there are parameters now to specify propagation and
	radio model. Removed different Ieee802.11 wireless NICs. Only Ieee80211
	remained and the mgmtType parameter can be used to configure the NIC.
	Simplifications in radio Ieee80211module. Added multiradio example.

2011-03-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Separated mf80211, ieee80211 and mobility feature and
	mf80211 and iee80211 can be compiled independently

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Interfaces renamed to start with I.

	Signals for statistics recording

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	Radio changed into a moduleinterface as it was originally intended

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(AirFrame);

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

	Checked in the new MAC model written by Levente Meszaros;
	see mac/ChangeLog for details.

	see mgmt/ChangeLog for details.

2005-08-04  Andras Varga

	Added placeholder for 802.11 infrastructure mode implementation;
	see mgmt/ChangeLog for details.
