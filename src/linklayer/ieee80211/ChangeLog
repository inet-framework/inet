	Takeover from INETMANET @ fff5dfd

	ChangeLog for the mac, radio and mgmt for further details.

	bug #361: Ieee80211MgmtSTA::initialize error

	The Ieee80211MgmtSTA needs to initialize at stage 1 because
	ChannelControl initializes numChannels at stage 0.

2011-11-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for bug #190 by Alfonso Ariza: 802.11 STA nodes abort the
	simulation

	If the STA node is not associated to an AP, it will send a packet with an
	invalid address to the mac and the mac will stop the simulation. It's
	necessary to modify the files Ieee80211STA.cc and Ieee80211STASimple.cc

	Copied changes from bugreport and from inetmanet.

	In Ieee80211MgmtSTA, I removed the old solution, and inserted new
	solution from manet.

2011-07-20  Levente Mészáros

	Renamed lowergateIn to lowerLayerIn and lowergateOut to lowerLayerOut.
	Renamed uppergateIn to upperLayerIn and uppergateOut to upperLayerOut.

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-04-28  Rudolf Hornig

	Added Mesh network support. Use Ieee80211NicMesh

2011-04-15  Rudolf Hornig

	Added new ieee802.11 model from INETMANET, supporting a,b,g,p modes.
	Use Ieee80211NewNic

2011-04-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Added support for optional submodules (Mgmt, hooks) in Ieee80211Nic.

2011-04-05  Rudolf Hornig

	Radio refactoring. Removed abstract baseclass. Instead of overriding
	virtual methods, there are parameters now to specify propagation and
	radio model. Removed different Ieee802.11 wireless NICs. Only Ieee80211
	remained and the mgmtType parameter can be used to configure the NIC.
	Simplifications in radio Ieee80211module. Added multiradio example.

2011-03-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Separated mf80211, ieee80211 and mobility feature and
	mf80211 and iee80211 can be compiled independently

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

	Radio changed into a moduleinterface as it was originally intended

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(AirFrame);

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2006-05-04  Andras Varga

	Checked in the new MAC model written by Levente Meszaros;
	see mac/ChangeLog for details.

2006-05-02  Andras Varga

	Started implementing infrastructure mode for 802.11;
	see mgmt/ChangeLog for details.

2005-08-04  Andras Varga

	Added placeholder for 802.11 infrastructure mode implementation;
	see mgmt/ChangeLog for details.

	If you are interested in the early history of the 802.11 code,
	change to the project root and type
