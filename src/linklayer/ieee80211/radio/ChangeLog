	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-28  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: end-line spaces removed, using spaces.pl in OMNeT++.

	Channel comntrol and ChannelControlExtended is merged and become
	ChannelCOntrolExtended. AirframeExtended is merged into AirFrame

2011-05-11  Andras Varga

	Compile fixes for MSVC

	- disambiguate arg types for pow(), sqrt(), etc. (ambiguity caused
	compile errors)
	- added implementations for missing C99 functions
	- MSVC does not have <stdint.h>, but most of its declarations are
	already provided by <omnetpp.h>

	Added new ieee802.11 model from INETMANET, supporting a,b,g,p modes.

2011-04-05  Rudolf Hornig

	Radio refactoring. Removed abstract baseclass. Instead of overriding
	virtual methods, there are parameters now to specify propagation and
	radio model.
