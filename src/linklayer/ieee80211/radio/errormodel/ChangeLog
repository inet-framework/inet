	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

	cosmetics: end-line spaces removed, using spaces.pl in OMNeT++.

	Compile fixes for MSVC

	- disambiguate arg types for pow(), sqrt(), etc. (ambiguity caused
	compile errors)
	- added implementations for missing C99 functions
	- MSVC does not have <stdint.h>, but most of its declarations are
	already provided by <omnetpp.h>

2011-04-15  Rudolf Hornig

	Added new ieee802.11 model from INETMANET, supporting a,b,g,p modes.
