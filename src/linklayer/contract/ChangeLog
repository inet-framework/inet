	MACAddress: fix of compile error introduced in "Refactored operator=..."
	commit

	op= was made inline there, but not removed from .cc file

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all INET classes.
	See base/ChangeLog for details.

	MACAddress comparison bugfixes [ZBojthe]

	The old version of compare() and compareTo() didn't work correctly when
	size of int type is smaller than 64 bits: sometimes returns fake equals
	because it truncated the difference to an integer.

	The compare() function too complex for operator< and operator>
	functions, replaced with simple comparison.

2011-11-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	MACAddress optimizations

	changes more functions to inline, replaces some function calls with body
	of called function reduce complexity of generateAutoAddress()

2011-07-19  Levente Meszaros

	Changed internal MACAddress representation from unsigned char[6] to
	uint64.

2011-06-09  Rudolf Hornig

	Added support to handle multicast adresses in the Ieee80211 mac layers
	(#339). It behaves exactly like the broadcast address.

	Broadcast is actually a specific case of a multicast address.

2011-06-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Fixed isMulticast testing as suggested by jesjones in #332

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-05-06  Zoltan Bojthe

	Mobility made independent of ChannelControl

	- moved ChannelControl* to world/radio

	- merged ChannelAccessExtended to ChannelAccess

	- host registration was moved from Mobility to the radio modules.
	 (There can be multiple radios per host, so ChannelControlExtended
	 now maintains a registration count for each host.)
	 Mobility now doesn't refer to ChannelControl at all, so one can
	 create mobile networks that don't contain ChannelControl at all;
	 ChannelControl is only needed for radio communication.

	- global playgroundSizeX/Y parameters have been replaced with
	 per-mobility constraintAreaX/Y, constraintAreaWidth/Height
	 parameters for most mobility modules
	 NOTE: Playground is now conceptionally unlimited, only the
	 movement of individual nodes are (can be) constrained to
	 rectangular areas. (This change was needed because mobility
	 modules now don't access ChannelControl that used to contain
	 the playgroundSizeX/Y parameters.)

	- x,y parameters have been renamed to initialX/Y; a new
	 initFromDisplayString parameter controls whether the initial
	 coordinates come from the display string or from the parameters
	 (for most modules; some mobility modules don't have these parameters)

	Example simulations are updated in a separate commit.

2011-04-27  Rudolf Hornig

	INET now compiles with MANET turnened off.

2011-04-20  Rudolf Hornig

	Initial takeover of MANET routing protocols from INETMANET.

2011-03-31  Rudolf Hornig

	Migrated Obstacle, Battery, Annotation and multi-radio support from
	INETMANET.

	Ethernet Layer: optimise #includes, code styling

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	Code style changes:

	- tab-to-space conversion
	- '{' to new line
	- too long lines
	- remove trailing whitespace from lines
	- indentation
