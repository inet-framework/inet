	NetAnimTrace: add node positions to tracefile when position changed

2012-02-04  Andras Varga

	util: added PatternMatcher

	This is a pattern matcher class for inifile-style patterns.

	It's near copy of an OMNeT++ internal class (in src/common/). Since we'd
	like to use patterns in INET (and this is generally useful
	functionality), we'll make part of the public OMNeT++ API in the 4.3
	version; until then we have this copy in inet/src/util/.

2011-11-16  Zoltan Bojthe

	int128/uint128: remove IP address and MAC address related functions
	from int128/uint128 classes

2012-01-18  Andras Varga

	getAddressLevel() moved from util/common.cc to the SCTP code

	That was its only usage; "address level" as a concept doesn't appear to
	be universally useful.

2012-01-18  Andras Varga

	common.cc: getLevel() --> getAddressLevel(); refinements on categorization

	IPv4: BROADCAST should probably be on level 0 per analogy with IPv6;
	IETF, TEST_NET, RESERVED are unused or special-purpose, probably better
	on level 0 as well.

2012-01-05  Zoltan Bojthe

	common.cc: getLevel() rewritten to be based on getAddressCategory()

2012-01-11  Zoltan Bojthe

	compiler warnings (in 1.99.1) about the Uint128 shift operators in

	converted to 64 bits (was 64-bit shift intended?)

	Changed internal MACAddress representation from unsigned char[6] to
	uint64.

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

	Eliminate compile warnings

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-02-02  Levente Meszaros

	Follow omnetpp changes related to include files.

	Include platdep/sockets.h only from those source files which really need

	- multiple copies of the same checksum functions factored out into
	  TCPIPChecksum.h/cc
	- TCP header serializer/parser rewritten for better option management.
	- SCTPSerializer: checksum() renamed to crc32() because it's not the
	  same algorithm as the convential TCP/IP checksum
	- tcp.h: use fixed-size int types (uint16_t, etc) instead of
	  int/short/char
	- some whitespace change (tabs to spaces)

	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)

	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2003-09-23  Andras Varga

	Source directory created.

	If you are interested in the early history of the code,
	change to the project root and type
