	IPv4Serializer.cc: bugfixes related to the serialization of fragmented
	packets (fragment offset, Don't Fragment bit, More Fragments bit)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	directories back into util/headerserializers, but into separate
	subdirectories (ipv4/, tcp/, sctp/, etc.)

2011-03-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Project Features support: moved header serializers to the contract/
	directories of various protocols (src/udp/contract/, etc.)

	fix previous commit for mingw: use the endian macros defined in defs.h

	thanks Ariza!

2009-12-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	Improved header serializers

	- multiple copies of the same checksum functions factored out into
	  TCPIPChecksum.h/cc
	- TCP header serializer/parser rewritten for better option management.
	- SCTPSerializer: checksum() renamed to crc32() because it's not the
	  same algorithm as the convential TCP/IP checksum
	- tcp.h: use fixed-size int types (uint16_t, etc) instead of
	  int/short/char
	- some whitespace change (tabs to spaces)

2009-11-05  Rudolf Hornig

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2006-02-14  Andras Varga

	Initial checkin of headerserializers, from Christian Dankbar, Irene
	Ruengeler and Michael Tuexen.

	If you are interested in the early history of the code,
	change to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- src/util/headerserializers INET/src/util/headerserializers \
	    Util/HeaderSerializers
