	TCP SACK ASSERT fix by Thomas Reschka

	The patch is fixing the issue which is described here:
	http://groups.google.com/group/omnetpp/browse_thread/thread/c39c2a55db10fc7d/1a6e05230c54ac7b?lnk=gst&q=TCP+SACK#1a6e05230c54ac7b

	In addition it avoids an ASSERT in setSackedBit() which appears when an
	ACK (with SACK option) is received and AckNo & SACK are below snd_una
	(this is no D-SACK case).

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks
