	 Added the packet drop feature  (draft-stewart-sctp-pktdrprep-15.txt),
	 the "sack immediately" feature (draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-sack-immediately)
	 and several alternatives to send fast retransmissions.

2013-07-17  Irene Ruengeler

	Added 8 new strategies for stream scheduling
	Patch for more statistics and better flow control.

2013-07-15  Irene Ruengeler

	Implemented SCTP Stream Reset (RFC 6525)

2013-07-11  Irene Ruengeler

	Implemented SCTP Authentication (RFC 4895).

2013-07-08  Irene Ruengeler

	Implemented Add-IP feature for SCTP (RFC 5061).

2013-06-21  Irene Ruengeler

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

	SCTP: getAddressLevel optimalization: call only once

2012-01-18  Andras Varga

	getAddressLevel() moved from common.cc to the SCTP code

	That was its only usage; "address level" as a concept doesn't appear to
	be universally useful.

2012-01-18  Andras Varga

	common: getLevel() --> getAddressLevel(); refinements on categorization

	IPv4: BROADCAST should probably be on level 0 per analogy with IPv6;
	IETF, TEST_NET, RESERVED are unused or special-purpose, probably better
	on level 0 as well.

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	NEDDOC fixes

2011-11-13  Andras Varga

	Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all INET classes.
	See base/ChangeLog for details.

2011-09-15  Zoltan Bojthe

	Fixes for ev.disable_tracing

	Also copied back old updateDisplayString() function to SCTP

2011-11-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	eliminate some warnings: variable set but not used

2011-07-28  Andras Varga

	UDP apps: change to UDPSocket; updated for the UDP API changes

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	change opp_error to throw cRuntimeError

2011-01-03  Alberto Cortes

	Fix SCTP Path.Max.Retrans threshold

	RFC4960 section 8.2, second paragraph, says:

	   When the value in the error counter exceeds the protocol parameter
	  'Path.Max.Retrans' of that destination address, the endpoint should
	  mark the destination transport address as inactive, and a
	  notification SHOULD be sent to the upper layer.

	But old code marks the address as inactive when the error counter is
	*equal* to Path.Max.Retrans instead of when it *exceeds* it. This bug
	leads to make premature handovers (about half the time of what it should
	be, due to the exponential grow of the RTO between retransmissions).

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	using getEncapsulatedPacket() instead deprecated getEncapsulatedMsg()

2010-10-18  Alberto Cortés

	Add scalars & vectors to SCTP for HBs & HB-ACKs

	4 new scalars keep track of the number of Heartbeats and Heartbeat-ACKs
	sent and received on each path. The vectors hold the time when they were
	sent or received.

2010-12-06  Rudolf Hornig

	Reverting previous commit.

2010-10-29  Rudolf Hornig

	Added some addinitinal statistics to SCTP

2010-10-18  Alberto Cortés

	Change some castings to check_and_cast

2010-10-07  Alberto Cortés

	Add "sent TSN" vector recording to SCTP

	SCTP already defines the vector pathTSN for recording the sent TSNs, but
	it was never used. This patch makes SCTP do the actual recording.

2010-05-21  Andras Varga

	SCTP compile fixes for msvc

2010-04-26  Rudolf Hornig

	Fixed an SCTP bug when primary path fails but the server continues to
	send ACKS on the primary path.

	Patch by Antonio M. Macías Ojeda reviewed by Irene Ruengeler

2010-04-16  Rudolf Hornig

	SCTP fix by Irene Rungeler

2010-03-26  Andras Varga

	UDP,TCP fix: port numbers were represented with (signed) short at
	places; SCTP: minor related change

	Signed short caused problems for large port numbers due to sign
	extension (see ASSERT(conn->localPort == localPort) in TCP.cc)
	[reported by Thomas Gamer]

2010-03-12  Rudolf Hornig

	Fixed compilation on windows. Unnecessary pthread references were
	removed from TCP dump too.

2010-03-11  Rudolf Hornig

	Added SCTP patch from Irene Rungeler.

2010-01-28  Zoltan Bojthe

	add FIXME suggest parentheses

2009-11-05  Rudolf Hornig

	Changes related to the TCP-SACK implementation from Thomas Reschka.

2009-08-26  Andras Varga

	cosmetics (warnings, tab-to-space, reindent, typos, dead code removal)

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	more gate labels added; also, fixed case of TCPOut gates (i.e. they got
	renamed to tcpOut)

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)
