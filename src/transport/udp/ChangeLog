	Fixed feature-related bugfix: possible memory leak if packet is
	multicast and IPv4 or IPv6 feature is disabled

2012-06-12  Rudolf Hornig

	Code takover from INETMANET-2.0:
	Added the possibility to specify the output interface when
	sending an UDP packet.
2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-03-12  Tamas Borbely

	Changes in the UDP socket API:

	The first call on an UDP socket do not need to be bind() or connect()
	anymore. It is possible to create a socket and sending data immediately
	by calling sendTo(). It is also possible to set socket options before
	calling connect() or bind(). connect() can be called several times.
	However the bind() call fails if the socket is already bound.

2012-02-14  Tamas Borbely

	Implement IP_MULTICAST_LOOP socket option for UDP sockets.
	If the option is true, then a copy of sent multicast datagrams
	will be looped back to local sockets. The option can be set
	by calling UDPSocket::setMulticastLoop(bool). The default value
	of the option is true.

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-02-09  Andras Varga

	Added QoS support (Type of Service / Traffic Class) to UDP; see
	UDPSetTypeOfServiceCommand

2012-01-27  Tamas Borbely

	UDP: generalize UDPJoinMulticastGroupCommand and
	UPDLeaveMulticastGroupCommand. The new commands
	(UDPJoinMulticastGroupsCommand and UDPLeaveMulticastGroupsCommand)
	accept more than one multicast groups.

	added two methods to UDPSocket:
	 - joinLocalMulticastGroups() joins to multicast groups
	   that are accepted by any interface.
	 - leaveLocalMulticastGroups() leaves all multicast groups.

	Fix: C++ type of ports in SocketDesc changed to int.
	They should be wide enough to store valid port values +
	the unspecified port value.

	fix for bug #516: UDP leaks multicast

2011-12-21  Andras Varga

	statistics:
	- revised rcvdPk, sentPk, dropPk
	- standardizing on lower case statistics titles
	- record packet counts in a less confusing way: as rcvdPk:count instead
	  of packetBytes(rcvdPk):count or rcvdPkBytes:count; total bytes is now
	  recorded as rcvdPk:sum(packetBytes)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

	UDP: fix #446: when there is no socket to deliver to, decapsulated
	packet remains in memory

2011-09-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	bug #347: fixes some compiler warnings.

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for cppcheck

2011-07-28  Andras Varga

	UDP: cosmetics: functions reordered; no other change

2011-07-28  Andras Varga

	Heavy API changes; added multicast, broadcast and ttl support.

	Features/improvements:
	- added support for the following socket options (see Unix setsockopt()):
	  time-to-live (unicast and multicast), broadcast, multicast output
	  interface, join multicast group, leave multicast group.
	- UDPControlInfo and UDPSocket has changed, see contract/ChangeLog!

	Bugs fixed:
	- connect without bind is now supported (used to be an error)
	- send has previously ignored the socket altogether
	- bug: for bind, port=0 was refused
	- it was not possible to receive broadcasts and multicasts

2010-03-26  Andras Varga

	* fix: represent port numbers with ushort

2008-06-29  Andras Varga

	* factored out createUDPPacket()

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-07-14  Andras Varga

	* UDPModule renamed to UDP

2003..2004  Andras Varga

	IPSuite extensive refactoring, see networklayer/ipv4/ChangeLog

2003-09-23  Andras Varga

	Initial version taken over from IPSuite.

	If you are interested in the early history of the UDP code, change
	to the project root and type
