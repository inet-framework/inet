	- rcvdPkBytes -> rcvdPk, etc.
	- RTPPayloadReceiver: signal renaming

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all INET classes.
	See base/ChangeLog for details.

2011-08-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	RTP: fixes for change to UDPSocket

	Binding UDP sockets to a port, without any IP addresses

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for cppcheck

2011-07-28  Andras Varga

	UDP apps: change to UDPSocket; updated for the UDP API changes

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	comments, whitespace, etc.

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	removed obsolete and misleading !WORK_IN_PROGRESS! files

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	using getEncapsulatedPacket() instead deprecated getEncapsulatedMsg()

2010-11-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	and labelling

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-06-14  Andras Varga

	* integrated Ahmed Ayadi's patch into the INET Fw, and ported to
	  OMNeT++ 4.0; some cleanup

	* refactoring:
	  - use C99 integer types (uint8_t etc) instead of u_int8_t
	  - converted some classes to msg files (all messages used to be
	    hand-coded C++ classes)
	  - renamed RTPEndsystemModule to RTP, RTCPEndsystemModule to RTCP

	* more work needed, see todo files

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2007-08-02  Ahmed Ayadi <ahmed.ayadi@sophia.inria.fr>

	* integrated to the INET Framework (replaced SocketInterfacePacket
	  based communication with UDPControlInfo, etc)

	* result released as patch, announced on the omnetpp-l list

2004-03-11  Andras Varga

	* added to the INET Framework as nonfunctional code (excluded from build)

	If you are interested in the early history of the RTP code, change
	to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- Transport/RTP INET/src/transport/rtp

2001-xx-xx  Arndt Buschmann <a.buschmann@gmx.de>

	* changes in RTPSenderStatusMessage.h/.cc and RTPPayloadSender.cc
	  (some messages contain an rtp timestamp now)

2001-10-20  Matthias Oppitz <Matthias.Oppitz@gmx.de>

	* initial revision, as part of IPSuite (Uni Karlsruhe)
