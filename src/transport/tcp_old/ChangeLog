    * fix: represent port numbers with ushort

2010-03-01  Andras Varga

    * Fixed following issues with patch submitted by Thomas Reschka:
        - too early transition from ESTABLISHED to CLOSE_WAIT state
          when FIN has been received but segments have been lost before. See bug #139
        - unnecessary delay before sending the last data segment if nagle is enabled
        - assert issue in TCPVirtualDataSendQueue.cc line 60. See bug #122

    * Fixed following issues with patch submitted by Thomas Reschka:
        - Restart of REXMIT timer on retransmission is not part of RFC 2581.
          This has been removed from TCPReno and TCPTahoe.
        - behavior of TCPReno after RTO. After REXMIT timeout TCP Reno
          should start slow start with snd_cwnd = snd_mss.
          If calling "retransmitData();" there is no rexmit limitation (bytesToSend > snd_cwnd)
          therefore "sendData();" has been modified and is called to rexmit outstanding data.

    * Fixed 'FIN does not get retransmitted' issue with patch submitted by Andras Varga and Thomas Reschka. See bug #123

    * added checking value of advertisedWindow parameter

2009-03-01  Andras Varga

    * fixed bug in TCPConnection::retransmitData(); patch from Claus Faller

2008-06-29  Andras Varga

    * some refactoring: created factory methods for TCPSegment and
    TCPConnection, to allow customizing them via subclassing

2006-03-22  Andras Varga

    * TCPConnectionEventProc.cc, TCPConnectionRcvSegment.cc: when the user
    issues CLOSE, defer transition to FIN_WAIT_1 until all data are sent.
    (Before this fix the transiton was made immediately, but that was
    harmless, i.e. it didn't affect TCP's external behaviour.)

2006-03-21  Andras Varga

    * TCPConnectionRcvSegment.cc: fixed incorrect behaviour when ACK of SYN
    carries data [reported by Joachim Meichle]

2005-07-20  Andras Varga

    * some sources moved into subdirs queues/ and flavours/

2005-07-14  Andras Varga

    * TCPMain renamed to TCP

2005-07-12  Andras Varga

    * TCPMain.cc, TCPConnectionBase.cc: TCP got confused when it received
    several active/passive opens with same local port number. Now it raises
    an error (this is like EADDRINUSE on *nix)

2005-07-06  Andras Varga

    * TCPConnectionRcvSegment.cc: fixed bug which caused closing of a
    connection to be reported 2MSL (240s) later to the user. Basically,
    the user has to be notified already when the connection enters the
    TIME_WAIT state. (TCP stays in TIME_WAIT for 240s or longer, and
    nothing can happen during that time that's of interest to the user.)
