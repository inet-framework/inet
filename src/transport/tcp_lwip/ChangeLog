2013-04-17  Zoltan Bojthe

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-28  Andras Varga

	TCP* : create an error when using old sendQueueClass / receiveQueueClass
	parameters

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)
