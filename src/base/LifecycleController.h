/**
 * Manages operations like shutdown/restart, suspend/resume, crash/recover
 * and similar operations for nodes (routers, hosts, etc), interfaces, and
 * protocols.
 *
 * Overview and usage are described in the NED file, you are advised to read
 * that first. The rest of this documentation concentrates on the C++ API.
 *
 * Operations are represented by C++ class derived from LifecycleOperation.
 * Simple modules that wish to participate in an operation need to implement
 * the ILifecycle interface (C++ class).
 *
 * An operation is initiated by calling the <tt>initiateStateChange(cModule *module,
 * LifecycleOperation *operation)</tt> method of this class. (This is often done
 * from a ScenarioManager script). This method applies the operation to the
 * given module (usually a host, router or network interface compound module).
 *
 * Operations may have multiple stages (think multi-stage initialization),
 * where each stage may take nonzero simulation time. The number of stages
 * are defined by the operation (its getNumStages() method).
 * Within a stage, the submodule tree is traversed, and initiateStateChange()
 * is invoked on each module that implements ILifecycle.
 *
 * Operations may take nonzero simulation time. A module that needs nonzero
 * simulation time to complete a stage (e.g. it wants to close TCP connections
 * or model finite shutdown/reboot time) can signal that in the return value
 * of initiateStateChange(). When it is done, it can signal that to
 * LifecycleController by invoking the callback passed to it in
 * initiateStateChange(). LifecycleController only regards the stage as completed
 * (and goes on to the next stage) when all participating modules have indicated
 * that they are done.
 *
 * Operations can be nested, that is, it's possible to initiate another operation
 * while one is underway.
 *
