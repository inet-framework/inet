/**
 *\page mobancpp MoBAN C++ reference
 * This is the C++ implementation reference for MoBAN, which is a configurable mobility model for wireless Body Area Networks. MoBANCoordinator and MoBANLocal
 * classes describe the behavior of the Coordinator module and local mobility module of the MoBAN, respectively. There are two more classes which are used in the
 * coordinator module.
 *
 * Class Posture is responsible for maintaining an instance of defined posture for the WBAN. In the initialization phase, the MoBANCoordinator reads the input
 * posture specification file (.xml) and makes a list of posture objects, each maintaining the information of one defined posture.
 *
 * Class PostureTransition is responsible for maintaining the configuration information regarding the spatial and temporal correlations in posture selection strategy of MoBAN.
 * In the initialization phase, the MoBANCoordinator reads the input configuration file and pass the given information about the area types, time domains, various
 * Markov transition matrices, and the setups which specify which matrix should be used in a particular space-time combination. During the simulation run, the class provides
 * a function that determines the proper Markov matrix for a given time and location.

/**
 * @brief This is the coordinator module of the MoBAN mobility model. It should be instantiated in the top level simulation network, once per WBAN.
 * The coordinator module is the main module that provides the group mobility and correlation between nodes in a WBAN.
 * In the initialization phase, it reads three user defined input files which are the postures specification file, a configuration file which includes all
 * required parameter for specific distributions, and the previously logged mobility pattern, if it is requested to use a logged pattern.
 * Note that all WBAN instances may use the same input files if they are exactly in the same situation.
 *
 * After the initialization phase, the MoBAN coordinator decides about the posture and the position of the Logical center of the group (WBAN).
 * The absolute position of the reference point of each belonging node is calculated by adding the current position of the logical center
 * by the reference point of that node in the selected posture. The coordinator sets the position of the reference point as well as
 * the speed and the radius of the local movement of nodes.
