	Split models directory into multiple directories:
	 contract - specifies the interface of mobility models
	 common - shared files among mobility models that are not complete mobility models
	 static - mobility models that actually don't move
	 single - single mobility models controlling only one moving object
	 group - group mobility models controlling multiple interlinked moving objects

	Moved the mobility models into the models/ subdirectory, so this folder
	only contains module interfaces. This was necessary so that we can
	turn mobility into an optional project feature (see .oppfeatures)

	See earlier history in the ChangeLog of models/.
