	Backport: mobility
	fingerprints of MoBAN mobility are changed

2014-01-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	backport: Mobility: Replaced getParentNode with the more inentional
	getContainingNode.

2013-04-12  Levente Mészáros

	backport: Logging: Refactored mobility logging to be more consistent and
	less redundant.

2013-10-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	backport: registerSignal() calls moved from initialize() to static
	variable declaration

2014-01-07  Zoltan Bojthe

	added/fixed @signal declarations, fixed type of emitted values

2013-10-24  Rudolf Hornig

	mobility: added missing INET_API macros.

2013-03-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	mobility: MoBANCoordinator: added FIXME

2013-08-21  Andras Varga

	StaticGridMobility: fixed 2 recently introduced bug

2013-06-11  Zoltan Bojthe

	mobility: redesigned StaticGridMobility - added new parameters, position
	calculation changed
	fingerprint changed

2013-05-29  Levente Mészáros

	TurtleMobility: Fixed getting the position from a mobility signal
	listener during initialize.

	The script was resumed before initialize finished resulting in incorrect
	positioning.

	Split models directory into multiple directories:
	 contract - specifies the interface of mobility models
	 common - shared files among mobility models that are not complete mobility models
	 static - mobility models that actually don't move
	 single - single mobility models controlling only one moving object
	 group - group mobility models controlling multiple interlinked moving objects

	INETMANET project.

2012-05-18  Rudolf Hornig

	Mobility models now correctly refer to the constraint area.

2012-04-27  Levente Meszaros

	Mobility: added default icon

	Moved the mobility models into the models/ subdirectory, so this folder
	only contains module interfaces. This was necessary so that we can
	turn mobility into an optional project feature (see .oppfeatures)

	See earlier history in the ChangeLog of models/.
