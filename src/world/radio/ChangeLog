	IChannelControl: added getPropagationSpeed()

2013-03-07  Zoltan Bojthe

	ChannelControl: eliminated LIGHT_SPEED variable, use SPEED_OF_LIGHT
	instead

2013-03-08  Zoltan Bojthe

	Added IdealChannelModel and IdealChannelModelAccess, to be used with
	IdealWirelessNic. See IdealWirelessNic for details.

	Takover from INETMANET @ fff5dfd

	Radio reception now can be disabled using enableReception/disableReception
	on ChannelControl.

	ChannelAccess now correctly unregisters the radio when destructed.

	Mobility: changed default value for constraintAreaSize* to -1 that is
	unbounded

2011-08-03  Levente Meszaros

	Changed findHost to search for a module upwards having @node() property.
	Moved down NotificationBoard lookup.

	We don't want to require a host to always have a NotificationBoard.
	Looking up a NotificationBoard in BasicModule all the time is too
	restrictive.

2011-07-19  Levente Meszaros

	Refactored mobility modules.

	See ChangeLog in the mobility directory for details.

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-06-02  Rudolf Hornig

	Review channel control module naming in NED/INI files. The channel
	control MUST be called "channelControl"; the lower case name is no longer
	accepted.

2011-05-19  Rudolf Hornig

	Added a SPEED_OF_LIGHT global constant in INETDefs.h

2011-05-19  Rudolf Hornig

	Original channel controller modified to work with radios instead of
	hosts. Channel controller extended is removed.

2011-05-17  Rudolf Hornig

	Channel comntrol and ChannelControlExtended is merged and become
	ChannelCOntrolExtended. AirframeExtended is merged into AirFrame

2011-05-06  Zoltan Bojthe

	ChannelController now deals only with radios and not hosts. This
	makes it possible to have hosts with several radio interfaces.
	The radios are registered/unregistered in the ChannelAccess module
	(previously host registration was done by the mobility modules).
	ChannelControl/ChannelAccess are now completely independent of the
	mobility modules. This means that if no mobility module is present
	in a host, the host's displaystring will be used to set the static
	positions of the radios.

	- moved ChannelControl* to world/radio

	- merged ChannelAccessExtended to ChannelAccess

	- host registration was moved from Mobility to the radio modules.
	  (There can be multiple radios per host, so ChannelControlExtended
	  now maintains a registration count for each host.)
	  Mobility now doesn't refer to ChannelControl at all, so one can
	  create mobile networks that don't contain ChannelControl at all;
	  ChannelControl is only needed for radio communication.

	- global playgroundSizeX/Y parameters have been replaced with
	  per-mobility constraintAreaX/Y, constraintAreaWidth/Height
	  parameters for most mobility modules
	  NOTE: Playground is now conceptionally unlimited, only the
	  movement of individual nodes are (can be) constrained to
	  rectangular areas. (This change was needed because mobility
	  modules now don't access ChannelControl that used to contain
	  the playgroundSizeX/Y parameters.)

	- x,y parameters have been renamed to initialX/Y; a new
	  initFromDisplayString parameter controls whether the initial
	  coordinates come from the display string or from the parameters
	  (for most modules; some mobility modules don't have these parameters)

	Example simulations are updated in a separate commit.

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-08-04  Andras Varga

	Added ChannelAccess and ChannelControl from Mobility Framework 1.0a5.

	If you are interested in the early history of the code,
	change to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- src/world INET/src/world World
