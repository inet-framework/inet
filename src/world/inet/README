The Delfoi Global Internet Delay Model

Overview:
The DELFOI (Delay Estimation Localized For Omnet++/Inet) model implements
end-to-end Internet delay including
  - node specific access network delay
  - node specific access bandwidths
  - Global Network Positioning (GNP) estimates of node to node minimum backbone
    delay
  - region-to-region specific jitter

The model usually is parametrized from user measurements obtained through the
website www.speedtest.net. With the parametrization file installed, it is
very easy to use (see example).

The parametrization for each node is sampled from the group (e.g. "US") specified
as Par or property.

- Example: examples/inet/gnpping

Requirements:
- gnplib
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnplib/

- Parametrization data: 
  speedtest.net datasets may be obtained from Ookla
  http://www.speedtest.net/contact.php
  Three days worth of measurement data ought to suffice.

- Automated scripts to generate parametrization data ("measured_data.xml") from
  speedtest.net measurements are included with gnplib
  in the vibello directory.

- Alternatively, an XML data set (though without access delay!) can be
  obtained from
  http://peerfact.kom.e-technik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/downloads/
  (You still need gnplib.)
