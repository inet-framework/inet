2013-08-22  ------ inet-2.2.0 released ------

2013-07-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	- stopTime checks changed: send packet when simTime() <= stopTime
      (some apps tested "simTime() < stopTime", another apps tested "simTime()<= stopTime")

2013-05-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	- Added NodeStatus::DOWN checks for initialize()
	- lifecycle: Enter_Method_Silent() was missed in some
	  handleOperationStage() function

2013-04-25  Levente Meszaros

	- Added ILifecycle to the rest of applications.
      (All application must either support lifecycle operations properly or
	   throw an error when executing any lifecycle operations.)

2013-04-23  Levente Meszaros

	Adapted TCPEcho and TCPBasicClient applications to lifecycle operations.

2013-04-22  Levente Meszaros

	App: Changed stopTime to use -1 to run the application forever.

2013-02-15  Rudolf Hornig

	TCPSessionApp: fixed signal name and removed non-exisiting signal def.

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

2012-11-16  Zoltan Bojthe

	TCPBasicClientApp: bugfix for #611: simulation generated an ASSERT if
	numRequestsPerSession parameter value larger than 1.

2012-10-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	tcpapp: minor fixes

2012-08-07  ------ inet-2.0.0 released ------

2012-06-25  ------ inet-1.99.5 released ------

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2011-12-22  Andras Varga

	statistics:
	- TCPBasicClientApp: added numSessions and numActiveSessions
	- removed "stats" where "histogram" was already present (it implies "stats")
	- standardizing on lower case statistics titles
	- record packet counts in a less confusing way: as rcvdPk:count instead
	  of packetBytes(rcvdPk):count or rcvdPkBytes:count; total bytes is now
	  recorded as rcvdPk:sum(packetBytes)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	NEDDOC fixes

2011-08-15  Andras Varga

	Adapted units to recent OMNeT++ change: replaced Kbps,KB,MB,GB with
	kbps,KiB,MiB,GiB

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	comments, whitespace, etc.

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	apps: renamed address/port params to localAddress/localPort where
	appropriate

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	apps: added/renamed parameters: 'sendInterval', 'stopTime'

	Renamed the following parameters to 'sendInterval':
	- messageFreq, waitTime, packetInterval, interval, waitInterval

	Added stopTime parameter to several apps:
	- TelnetApp, UDPBasicApp, TCPBasicClientApp, IPvXTrafGen, EtherAppCli

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Zoltan Bojthe

2011-02-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	TCP, TCP_NSC, TCP_lwip: implemented "bytestream" transfer modes

	also refactoring of queues for "object" and "bytecount" transfer modes

2011-02-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	Obsolete parameters in NED files

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	Code style changes:

	- tab-to-space conversion
	- '{' to new line
	- too long lines
	- remove trailing whitespace from lines
	- indentation

	TCPSessionApp: calculate received bytes correctly

2010-02-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Fixed assert in passive mode. Patch by Alberto CortÃ©s. TCPSessionApp
	when configured to work in pasive mode, called TCPSocket.listen()
	instead of TCPSocket.listenOnce(), thus forking the socket. When
	TCPSocket.processMessage() was called on ESTABLISHED, the
	ASSERT(belongsToSocket(msg)) failed.

	Fixed by calling TCPSocket.listenOnce() instead.

2009-07-21  Andras Varga

	added default icons (mostly to *App modules)

2009-07-19  Andras Varga

	added further module @labels (ethernet-node, wireless-node, mpls-node);
	added default icons to several module types

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	more gate labels added; also, fixed case of TCPOut gates (i.e. they got
	renamed to tcpOut)

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)

	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)

	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2006-03-22  Andras Varga

	Added TCPSpoof module from some external project

2005-08-04  Andras Varga

	Added several app models: TCPBasicClientApp, TCPEchoApp, TCPSessionApp,
	TCPGenericSrvApp, TCPGenericSrvThread, TPSinkApp, TCPSrvHostApp,
	TelnetApp
