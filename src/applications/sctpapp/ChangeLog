2013-07-29  Irene Ruengeler

	sctp: Added the packet drop feature (draft-stewart-sctp-pktdrprep-15.txt), 
	the "sack immediately" feature (draft-ietf-tsvwg-sctp-sack-immediately) 
	and several alternatives to send fast retransmissions.

2013-07-17  Irene Ruengeler

	- Added 8 new strategies for stream scheduling
	- Added NED parameters streamRequestLengths, streamRequestRatio, streamPriorities
	- implemented SCTP Stream Reset (RFC 6525)
	- new method: SCTPClient::sendStreamResetNotification()
	- added missing sctp auth test.

2013-07-03  Irene Ruengeler

	Implementation of Partial Reliability SCTP (RFC 3758) 

2013-05-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	- Added NodeStatus::DOWN checks for initialize()

	- lifecycle: Enter_Method_Silent() was missed in some
	  handleOperationStage() function

2013-04-25  Levente Meszaros

	App: Added ILifecycle to the rest of applications.

	All application must either support lifecycle operations properly or
	throw an error when executing any lifecycle operations.

2013-04-22  Levente Meszaros

	App: Changed stopTime to use -1 to run the application forever.

2013-04-03  Irene Ruengeler

	Refactoring, doc changes, renames

2011-12-21  Andras Varga

	statistics:
	- SCTPClient/SCTPPeer: renamed "sentEchoedPk" to "echoedPk"
	- standardizing on lower case statistics titles
	- record packet counts in a less confusing way: as rcvdPk:count instead
	  of packetBytes(rcvdPk):count or rcvdPkBytes:count; total bytes is now
	  recorded as rcvdPk:sum(packetBytes)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	eliminate some warnings: variable set but not used

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	SCTPPeer: add constructor/destructor, move some code from finish() to
	destructor

	 - also revise map cleanings

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for cppcheck

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	SCTP: bugfixes: too small buffers, map::iterator incrementation after
	erase

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	SCTP apps: cosmetics

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	SCTPServer: fix: 'socket' local var was used instead of class member

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	SCTP apps: refactoring: more concise parsing of "localAddress" param

	Use cStringTokenizer and IPvXAddressResolver for parsing.

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	SCTP apps: address/port to localAddress/localPort

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	SCTP apps: cosmetics: space changes, removal of unused types, etc.

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	comments, whitespace, etc.

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	SCTP apps: fix: changed int/double echoFactor to bool echo

	echoFactor was declared as int/int32/double at various places, but was
	used as a bool (so it was not a "factor" at all.)

	Renamed to 'echo', and changed the type to 'bool'

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-03-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	change simsignal_t member variables to static member

2011-03-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	Features: TCP, UDP, SCTP

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Interfaces renamed to start with I.

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	Code style changes:

	- tab-to-space conversion
	- '{' to new line
	- too long lines
	- remove trailing whitespace from lines
	- indentation

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	renamed @signal to @statistic modeHint= to record=

2010-02-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	some code corrections

2010-02-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	convert statistics to use signals

2010-06-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	use signals for statistics recording

2010-05-21  Andras Varga

	more gate labels added; also, fixed case of TCPOut gates (i.e. they got
	renamed to tcpOut)
