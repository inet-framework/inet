    DHCPServer and Client: Major changes made both in client's and
    server's state machine. It is now extended with new states INIT-REBOOT
    and REBOOTING and with new message types DHCPNAK and DHCPDECLINE.

    With the new REBOOTING states scenarios with lifecycle events
    now work correctly.

    The server's performance modeling has been removed. The inner
    representation of the DHCP options are moved to a DHCPOptions
    INET message definition file.

    The client module currently does not support multiple DHCP servers
    and BOOTP relay agents.

    The whole implementation has been rewieved to bring it closer to
    the standards defined in RFC 2131 and 2132.
