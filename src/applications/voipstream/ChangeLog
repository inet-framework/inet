	VoIPSinkApp: error handling change; refactoring

	Raise error instead of silently dropping the packet when:
	- it receives a packet from a third party during a session (concurrent
	  sessions are not supported); checks IP address, port, ssrc
	- encoding parameters of received voice packes change during a session

	Only cause of drops is now late packets (seqNum or timeStamp already
	passed)

	Refactoring:
	- some functions became void from bool
	- fix for dropPk signal sending

2011-12-21  Andras Varga

	statistics:
	- removed dead statistics "droppedBytes" from VoIPSinkApp
	- revised rcvdPk, sentPk, dropPk
	- standardizing on lower case statistics titles
	- record packet counts in a less confusing way: as rcvdPk:count instead
	  of packetBytes(rcvdPk):count or rcvdPkBytes:count; total bytes is now
	  recorded as rcvdPk:sum(packetBytes)

	UDP apps: change to UDPSocket; updated for the UDP API changes

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

	makefrag sets some include/library flags based on feature selection

	- makefrag checks installation of required libraries.
	- and add tests for some features in source files for
	  checking library existing.

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks
