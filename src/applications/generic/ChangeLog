	IPvX bugfix #468: IPvXTrafGen: packetLength volatile parameter
	was only read in once, in initialize()

2011-12-21  Andras Varga

	statistics:
	- revised recording modes: removed "stats" where "histogram" was
	  already present (it implies "stats")
	- revised rcvdPk, sentPk
	- standardizing on lower case statistics titles
	- record packet counts in a less confusing way: as rcvdPk:count instead
	  of packetBytes(rcvdPk):count or rcvdPkBytes:count; total bytes is now
	  recorded as rcvdPk:sum(packetBytes)

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	NEDDOC fixes

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for cppcheck

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	IPvXTrafGen, UDPBasicApp: remove unused variable

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	comments, whitespace, etc.

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	statistics: emit pk (cPacket*) signals instead of pkBytes etc; added
	more statistics

	Utilize packetBytes() result filter in @statistic to record byte counts

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	apps: IPvXTrafSink factored out to separate file

2011-07-18  Andras Varga

	apps: added/renamed parameters: 'sendInterval', 'stopTime'

	Renamed the following parameters to 'sendInterval':
	- messageFreq, waitTime, packetInterval, interval, waitInterval

	Added stopTime parameter to several apps:
	- TelnetApp, UDPBasicApp, TCPBasicClientApp, IPvXTrafGen, EtherAppCli

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-27  Andras Varga

	tab-to-space in all source files

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-03-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	change simsignal_t member variables to static member

2011-03-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	#include, code style, strtok -> cStringTokenizer

2011-03-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	code styling

2011-03-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	features: add *_examples features, add SCTP feature

	correcting some #include, etc

2011-03-03  Zoltan Bojthe

	features: TCP_NSC, TCP_lwip, IPv6 completed

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	additional update

2010-03-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	add statistics by using signals

2009-07-21  Andras Varga

	added default icons (mostly to *App modules)

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	more gate labels added; also, fixed case of TCPOut gates (i.e. they got
	renamed to tcpOut)

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2009-06-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Sends a packet ONLY if numPackets > 0. Fixed a bug when packetWas sent
	out even if numPackets was 0

2009-06-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Fix. Timer event in IPTrafGen was not deleted at the end of the
	simulation.

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2003..2004  Andras Varga

	IPSuite extensive refactoring, see networklayer/ipv4/ChangeLog

2003-09-23  Andras Varga

	Initial checkin of IPSuite's traffic generator modules.

	If you are interested in the early history of the code, change
	to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- Applications/Generic INET/src/applications/generic
