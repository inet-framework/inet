	TCP_lwIP: rename TCP_lwip to TCP_lwIP

2011-05-17  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for MPLS: the _LSR and _FAILED nodes must have same parameters

2011-04-14  Zoltan Bojthe

	xMIPv6Feature: includes, haveClass() --> firstAvailable(), code style

2011-03-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	NED: hasClass()/haveClass() fixes

2011-03-29  Zoltan Bojthe

	featuresupport: add PPP feature, correcting tcpType, udpType in NED
	files

2011-03-10  Rudolf Hornig

	Moved NAMTrace and NAMTraceWriter to the obsolete directory.

2011-03-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Features: UDP

	- added IUDP interface

2011-03-08  Zoltan Bojthe

	Features: TCP_BASE, TCP_INET features added

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2010-03-12  Andras Varga

	default value -1 (auto) for namid parameters

2009-07-21  Andras Varga

	labels change: EtherFrame/PPPFrame labels on hosts/routers renamed to
	EtherFrame-conn/PPPFrame-conn, so that EtherMAC, PPPInterface etc are
	not offered by the palette when editing a network

2009-07-19  Andras Varga

	added further module @labels (ethernet-node, wireless-node, mpls-node);
	added default icons to several module types

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	more gate labels added; also, fixed case of TCPOut gates (i.e. they got
	renamed to tcpOut)

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	added @labels(node) to hosts/routers so that they appear at top of the
	palette when editing a network (in OMNeT++ 4.1+)

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2003..2004  Andras Varga

	IPSuite extensive refactoring, see networklayer/ipv4/ChangeLog

2003-09-23  Andras Varga

	Code taken over from original IPSuite and MPLS models.

	If you are interested in the early history of the code, change
	to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- Nodes/MPLS INET/src/nodes/mpls
