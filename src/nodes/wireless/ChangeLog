2013-06-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	AccessPoint: made eth[] modules replaceable

2013-06-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	AccessPoint: replaced EtherMAC with EthernetInterface so that
	external queues can be used (useful for e.g. QoS)

2013-06-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	AccessPoint: added NodeStatus module, required for lifecycle operation
	support

2013-03-21  Levente Meszaros

	AccessPoint: added InterfaceTable unconditionally; also added 
	NotificationBoard, required by InterfaceTable.

2013-01-30  ------ inet-2.1.0 released ------

	AccessPoint: added InterfaceTable conditionally

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2011-08-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	AccessPoint fix: display string contained "q=queue" instead of
	"q=txQueue" (EtherMAC internal queue object is called "txQueue")

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-18  Zoltan Bojthe

	NEDDOC fixes

2011-08-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	fix for AccessPoint management type

2011-07-21  Levente Meszaros

	Removed mgmtType from IWirelessNic and from implementors.

	There is no need to set this parameter in the subclasses, because it is
	the default in Ieee80211Nic.

2011-07-20  Levente Meszaros

	Renamed uppergateIn to upperLayerIn and uppergateOut to upperLayerOut.

2011-07-19  Levente Meszaros

	Refactored mobility modules.

	See ChangeLog in the mobility directory for details.

2011-06-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	MACRelayUnit fixes: remove numWirelessPorts, don't send back packet to
	wireless port

	The AP management send back packets to radio

2011-06-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixing features: dependency, etc.

	also moves wireless IPv4 hosts from nodes/wireless to nodes/inet

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-10  Andras Varga

	Packages moved: battery, mobility, scenario

	mobility models: src/mobility -> src/mobility/models IMobility:
	base/mobility -> src/mobility

	battery models: src/battery -> src/battery/models IBattery (new): ->
	src/battery

	ScenarioManager: src/world -> src/world/scenario

	IManetRouting: src/base/manetrouting -> src/networklayer

2011-04-27  Rudolf Hornig

	INET now compiles with MANET turnened off.

2011-04-20  Rudolf Hornig

	Initial takeover of MANET routing protocols from INETMANET.

2011-04-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Turned several modules optional: transport level protocols, relayUnit,
	mobility, Hook modules in NetworkLayer are created ONLY if they are
	really needed. StandardHost and Router have common link and networ layer
	(BaseHost). Wireless and AdhocHost is derive from StandardHost. Removed
	MobileHost (it is now AdhocHost), FailedRouter (was not used and trivial
	to implement), BurstHost moved to examples dir (too specific).

2011-04-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Added support for optional submodules in AccessPoint and in
	Ieee80211Nic.

2011-04-08  Rudolf Hornig

	Removed different Ieee802.11 wireless NICs. Only Ieee80211 remained and
	the mgmtType parameter can be used to configure the NIC.

2011-04-07  Rudolf Hornig

	Fix for MacRelayUnit. Now correctly broadcasts the packets on all
	wireless interfaces.

2011-04-07  Rudolf Hornig

	Simplifications in radio Ieee80211module. Added multiradio example.

2011-03-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for wireless (WirelessHostSimplified.ned and examples)

2011-03-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	featuresupport: fix wireless nodes and features

2011-03-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	changes on wireless nodes, remove deprecated nodes

2011-03-30  Zoltan Bojthe

	NED: hasClass()/haveClass() fixes

2011-03-29  Zoltan Bojthe

	featuresupport: add PPP feature, correcting tcpType, udpType in NED
	files

2011-03-29  Zoltan Bojthe

	featuresupport: add ETHERNET feature

2011-03-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Features: UDP

	- added IUDP interface

2011-03-09  Zoltan Bojthe

	Features: TCP, UDP

2011-03-08  Zoltan Bojthe

	Features: TCP_BASE, TCP_INET features added

2011-03-08  Rudolf Hornig

	mf80211, ieee80211 and mobility feature

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-01  Rudolf Hornig

	Module interface renaming.

2011-02-28  Rudolf Hornig

	EtherMAC interface introduced and a more configurable standard host

2011-02-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	Obsolete parameters in NED files

2011-02-23  Zoltan Bojthe

	StandardHost* : enable differ udp, tcp, sctp Application Types in one
	Host

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2009-07-21  Andras Varga

	labels change: EtherFrame/PPPFrame labels on hosts/routers renamed to
	EtherFrame-conn/PPPFrame-conn, so that EtherMAC, PPPInterface etc are
	not offered by the palette when editing a network

2009-07-19  Andras Varga

	added further module @labels (ethernet-node, wireless-node, mpls-node);
	added default icons to several module types

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	more gate labels added; also, fixed case of TCPOut gates (i.e. they got
	renamed to tcpOut)

2009-07-18  Andras Varga

	added @labels(node) to hosts/routers so that they appear at top of the
	palette when editing a network (in OMNeT++ 4.1+)

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2006-09-03  Andras Varga

	Initial version. [commit is marked as tuexen due to svn client misconfiguration]

	If you are interested in the early history of the code, change
	to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- INET/src/nodes/wireless Nodes/Wireless
