	Features: add more features

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)
