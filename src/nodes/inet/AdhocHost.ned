// A wireless host containing routing, mobility and battery components.
// Supports only IPv4 protocol, TCP and UDP as transport protocol.
// This is a typical mobile node which can participate in adhoc routing
// and may have TCP/UDP applications installed. Supports ICMP (ping) too.

// - By default contains a single wireless cards, however it can be configured
//   by the numRadios parameter. Wirless card type is configured by the

// - Node mobility can be set using **.mobility.typename
