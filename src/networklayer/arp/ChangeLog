	ARP: is now sensitive to IPv4 config changes (reacts to
	NF_INTERFACE_IPv4CONFIG_CHANGED), and invalidates the cache
	if necessary. )

	Original patch modified by Zoltan Bojthe:
	- removed localAddressVector member
	- added 'owner' to ARPCacheEntry (used in GlobalArpCache)

2013-05-09  Levente Meszaros

	ARP: Fixed when there's no IP address during initialize.

2013-04-17  Andras Varga

	ARP: added lifecycle support

	mapping an IPv4 multicast address to a multicast MAC address as specified
	in RFC112, section 6.4

	IPv4 bugfix #469: ARP: global cache is incompatible with dynamic module
	creation

	bug was: The initialize() and destructor functions of the ARP module
	clear the global ARP cache. If it is called during simulation, then any
	subsequent ARP request stops the simulation with an error.

	statistics: ARP: wording

2011-08-02  Andras Varga

	Set ETHERTYPE_IPv4 on outgoing packets

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-11-04  Zoltan Bojthe

	eliminate some warnings: variable set but not used

2011-08-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	fixes for cppcheck

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-28  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: end-line spaces removed, using spaces.pl in OMNeT++.

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-03-31  Zoltan Bojthe

	change opp_error to throw cRuntimeError

2010-11-22  Rudolf Hornig

	Added GlobalARP support (from INETMANET)

2011-02-25  Zoltan Bojthe

	fix: cannot use "%d" format for size_t on 64-bit systems; use '<<' instead

2011-02-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	Eliminate compile warnings

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

	@statistic: added missing 'vector' recording mode

2010-03-05  Andras Varga

	update for omnet++ 4.1b3:

	renamed @signal to @statistic modeHint= to record=

2010-02-22  Zoltan Bojthe

	convert statistics to use signals

2010-06-24  Zoltan Bojthe

	use signals for statistics recording

	indent changes - from Thomas Reschka

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2008-07-08  Andras Varga

	* ARP: performance: introduced nicOutBaseGateId for use in send(),
	instead of looking up the gate by name each time

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-08-04  Andras Varga

	ARP code moved from NetworkInterfaces/ARP/ into Network/ARP/.

2004-04-26  Andras Varga

	Initial revision of the ARP code, written from scratch.

	If you are interested in the early history of the ARP code, change
	to the project root and type

	$ gitk -- NetworkInterfaces/ARP Network/ARP INET/src/networklayer/arp
