	Batman:
	- Updated and expanded documantation
	- Updated the code to the lates available Batman version.
	- Numerous optimizations.
	- Fixed several memory leaks
	- Fixed routing table corruption and possible crash when multiple
	  radios were used in a single host
	- Fixed decapsulation of incoming packets. Now it checks for the
	  type of decapsulated packet.
	- Fix for a problem when aggregated batman packets were
	  dropped erronously.
	- Added HNA support. Nodes can advertise external networks,
	  so traffic towards those networks can be routed correctly.
	  Use the announcedNetworks parameter to specufy multiple connected
	  external networks.

	Batman: bugfix

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks
