	DYMO: redesigned timers:

	The old code generated 5 timer messages for each routing entry, 1 timer
	message for each RREQ list entry, and 2 timer messages for SeqNumLoss.
	It was inefficient and also generated a big chaos in elog.

	The new code uses only one periodic timer message that goes off every
	1 sec, and triggers the expiry check of all entries in the table.
	(It is enough to check once per second whether a route or RREQ
	has timed out, because their lifetime is normally several seconds).

	Also: a series of small, cosmetic changes

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks
