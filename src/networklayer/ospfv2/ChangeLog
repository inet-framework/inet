	- changed the signature of OSPF::insertExternalRoute() 
	- a single IPv4AddressRange can be added to an Area only once
	- OSPF IPv4AddressRange changes:
	    added some functions and operators, removed IPv4AddressRange_Less class
	- use std::set instead std::map, use type AreaID instead std::string in OSPFRouting
	- remove IPv4Address_Less, maps can use operator the '<' operator of the IPv4Address
	- Area::info() fixes
	- show "0.0.0.0" instead "<unspec>"
	- the router interfaces will join the OSPF multicast groups automatically 
	- eliminate IPv4Address <--> int conversions, use IPv4Address member
	    functions for conversions, if needed
	- use IPv4Address type instead of unsigned long for LinkStateID, RouterID, AreaID
	- renamed the two overloaded getArea() functions to getAreaByID() and getAreaByAddr()
	- fixes for network address/mask comparations
	- bugfix: do not add the network address to the nextHop list
	- bugfix: OSPFLSAHeader comparator was asimmetric
	    ( booth operator<(MAX_AGE,0) and operator<(0,MAX_AGE) were true at the same time)
	- changed type of interface index from unsigned char to integer
	- uses 224.0.0.5 224.0.0.6 constants for the OSPF multicast groups from IPv4Address.h
	- removed checksum field from the OSPFPacket
	- uses the byteLength field of cPacket instead packetLength of OSPFPacket
	- now it calculates the packet length (was missing)
	- uses IP_MAX_HEADER_BYTES from IPv4Datagram instead IPV4_HEADER_LENGTH from OSPFCommon.h

	XML config changes:
	- improved error detection in xml config
	- replaced the ospfConfigFile string-type ned parameter with ospfConfig parameter (xml type)
	- uses IPvXAddressResolver for reading IP address and IP netmask values from xml
	- uses @name instead @id to identify the routers in the xml config
	- most attributes in xml config became optional, and default values
	    come from ned the parameters of OSPFRouting (with same name)
	- modified xml schema: converted most subnodes to attributes
	- Added etc/OSPFold_to_OSPFnew.xsl for converting old xml to new, and
	    converted ospf xml files to new the format in examples
	    (you must convert router@id to router@name by hand).
	- add @toward attribute to XML for easier interface specification
	    old: interfaces were specified by their name (e.g. ifName="eth0"). 
	    new: interfaces can be specified by their name (e.g. ifName="eth0"), 
	    or by the name of a module connected to the interface (e.g. towards="Area3.N9")
	- fixed OSPF.xsd schema

	IPv4Route: removed RouteType type field and getType(), setType()
	  functions, too

2012-03-20  ------ inet-1.99.4 released ------

2012-03-01  Levente Meszaros

	Gateway is now correcty set on routing entries.

2012-02-24  ------ inet-1.99.3 released ------

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	IPv4Route: member variables made private, updated OSPFv2 and BGP
	accordingly

	OSPFv2 and BGP had redundant getters/setters in OSPFRoutingTableEntry
	etc, they were removed

2012-01-19  Andras Varga

	Adapted to change: "host" in IPv4Route renamed to "destination"

2012-01-09  Andras Varga

	Adapted to RoutingTable change: IPv4Route pointers returned by
	RoutingTable are no longer const

2011-11-18  ------ INET-1.99.2 released ------

2011-07-19  Andras Varga

	cPolymorphic -> cObject (cPolymorphic became cObject in OMNeT++ 4.0)

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-03-02  Zoltan Bojthe

	change opp_error to throw cRuntimeError

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-10  Zoltan Bojthe

	Code style changes:

	- tab-to-space conversion
	- '{' to new line
	- too long lines
	- remove trailing whitespace from lines
	- indentation

2010-09-22  Andras Varga

	Changes related to the new BGP model: OSPFRouting::insertExternalRoute(),
	etc.

2010-08-13  Andras Varga

	* coding style made more consistent with the rest of the INET:
	- changed method names to start with lower-case letter
	- changed enum constants to all-capitals with underscores
	- removed excessive in-line spaces
	- removed superfluous "void" keywords from arg-less methods

2009-03-25  ------ INET-20090325 released ------

2008-12-11  Andras Varga

	* added LGPL headers to files

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2006-05-01  Andras Varga

	* checked in more patches from author of this model, Andras Babos

2005-10-28  Andras Varga

	Initial revision of the OSPFv2 model, written by Andras Babos for MSc
	final project at TU Budapest, with some help from Andras Varga.

	If you are interested in the early history of the OSPF code, change
	to the project root and type
