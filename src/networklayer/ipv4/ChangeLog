    * IP: set timeToLive to 1 if the destination is isLinkLocalMulticast() to
        prevent broadcasting to non-neighbouring routers.

    * RoutingTable: implemented routing cache [code based on OverSim
    patch]; similar performance optimization for isLocalAddress()

    * IP: performance: remember outputQueue gate pointer instead of
    looking up the gate by name for each send(). Note: could do the
    same optmization for other gates as well, but this gate is much
    more often used than the others

    * introduced IRoutingTable, to allow users implement their own
    RoutingTables and plug them into INET simulations, without any
    change to the base INET.

    * RoutingTable: properly fire notifications on routing table changes

    * wrapped naked data members of IPv4Route into getters/setters

    * RoutingTable: enforce by returning "const" pointers that routes
    already added cannot be changed any more (one must delete and
    re-add it)

    * IP: factored out a createIPDatagram method

    * IP.cc: obey new "outputPort" field of IPControlInfo when sending
    multicast datagram

    * RoutingTableParser.cc: 5th field of a route in routing files is
    the metric (so far it was "preferences" but in fact it was unused)

    * IP.cc: don't forward "link-local" multicast addresses (224.0.0.x)

2005-07-04  Andras Varga

    * RoutingTable: localDeliver() ignores interface netmask [reported by
    Michael Tuexen]

    * RoutingTable: interface netmask functionality is now achieved by
    routes of type IFACENETMASK added to the routing table. These routes
    are re-build whenever notification is received that there was a change
    in the interface IPv4 configurations.
