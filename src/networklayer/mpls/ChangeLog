	NEDDOC fixes

2011-11-13  Levente Meszaros, Zoltan Bojthe

	Refactored operator= and copy constructor in all INET classes.
	See base/ChangeLog for details.

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

2011-05-30  ------ INET-1.99.1 released ------

2011-05-26  Zoltan Bojthe

	Renamed IP... classes to IPv4... or IPvX...

2011-03-03  ------ INET-1.99.0 released ------

2011-02-22  Andras Varga

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

2011-01-13  Zoltan Bojthe

	using getEncapsulatedPacket() instead deprecated getEncapsulatedMsg()

2010-06-21  Zoltan Bojthe

	indent changes - from Thomas Reschka

2009-12-20  Andras Varga

	Fixed MPLSPacket assignment operator.

	std::stack had to be replaced with std::vector, because stack does not
	support random access, needed by the new info() method.

	Reported by Sebastian Kehr and Alfonso Ariza Quintana

2009-07-17  Levente Meszaros

	Added labels to gates to so that the graphical editor can match them
	when the user creates a connection:

	@labels(EtherFrame); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/up); labels(Ieee802Ctrl/down);
	@labels(TCPCommand/up); @labels(TCPCommand/down);
	@labels(UDPControlInfo/up); @labels(UDPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(Ieee80211Frame);  @labels(IPControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPControlInfo/up);  @labels(IPDatagram);
	@labels(IPv6ControlInfo/up); @labels(IPv6ControlInfo/down);
	@labels(IPv6Datagram)

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-11-02  Andras Varga

	* updated to Vojta Janota's latest code

2005-10-03  Andras Varga

	* checked in Vojta Janota's implementation which entirely replaces old code

2003-2004  Andras Varga

	MPLS/RSVP-TE/LDP models:

	* an initial comment: the MPLS/RSVP-TE/LDP models represent a very large
	  body of code, written by a single person -- a very remarkable achievement.
	  It will take quite some time to fully understand and verify the code.

	* Jack Foo (CTIE, Monash Uni) has worked a lot with the original model
	  codebase. He provided heaps of patches which will have to be merged
	  into this (somewhat changed) codebase

	* code changed to use LIBTableAccess, LDPAccess, MPLSAccess etc classes
	  instead of base classes. Some of these can probably be eliminated
	  in the future, because these models use direct message sending
	  at places where connections would probably be better, and that's why
	  they need to find MPLS etc submodules.

	* access to TED changed to TED::getGlobalInstance()

	* ev << "Error occurred: ..."  changed to error("...") in all places --
	  pops up an error dialog, so surely cannot go unnoticed (none popped up yet :-).

	* Replaced one thousand C-style casts ((<nop>RsvpMessage*)msg)
	  with check_and_cast<>. Luckily they caught no errors when run.

	* MPLS: 400-line activity() converted to handleMessage() and split up
	  into three. This was only one: there are still many very long
	  functions (several hundred lines!!!) with lots of copy/pasted
	  code blocks -- this a major headache and a maintentance nightmare.
	  All these methods badly need to be split up into smaller ones, and
	  the common/repeating parts factored out into functions.

	* OSPF/TE: lots of std::vector code. Changed pointers to references
	  (const references wherever possible). Commented calculateERO()
	  methods. A bug due to incorrect STL usage (pointers to elements of
	  std::vector) has been worked around, it'll be properly fixed later.
	  Also some of the loops which do linear search could possibly be made
	  more efficient.

	* Uses ints to represent IP addresses throughout the code. It would
	  probably be better to use the IPAddress class (fits into 4 bytes
	  too) or maybe at least "typedef unsigned int ipaddress" -- this
	  looks like a huge undertaking, not done yet.

	* Some general tidying (e.g. run all code through the "indent" program),
	  some bugfixes (STL usage, "not owner of message", etc.)

	A second round of refactoring:

	* OSPF-TE: renamings to enforce naming convention on variables & types

	* LDP, RSVP-TE hand-coded message classes migrated to .msg files

	* LDP rewritten for new TCP model

	* LIBTable public interface revised, table contents made inspectable in Tkenv

	* MPLS model and MPLSPacket extensive refactoring & dead code removal

	* MPLS simulation examples revised, e.g. removed tons of empty LIB &
	  PRT table files for clarity

2003-10-03  Andras Varga

	* fixed a lot of "unused variable" warnings
	* made it compile with MSVC 6.0

2003-09-19  Andras Varga

	Added MPLS/LDP/RESVP-TE models written by Xuan Thang Nguyen at
	University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) as a Capstone project.
	Original URL (now defunct):
	    http://charlie.it.uts.edu.au/~tkaphan/xtn/capstone/

	If you are interested in the early history of the MPLS code,
	change to the project root and type
