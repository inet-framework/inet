	IPv6: bugfix: datagram source IP address remained unfilled when IPv6
	sent a HL packet to neighbor discovery (ND)

	Solution:
	- IPv6 adds "IPv6-fromHL" parameter to IPv6Datagram before sending it to ND;
	- IPv6 reads and removes the parameter when it receives an IPv6Datagram from ND

	- added fromHL parameter to determineOutputInterface()
	- handleDatagramFromNetwork() was merged to endService(), and reads
	  fromHL value from the "IPv6-fromHL" parameter of IPv6Datagram.

	RoutingTable6: fire change notifications when the routes are changed

	RoutingTable6: added factory methods for creating route objects,
	so that subclasses can use their own route types

2013-07-25  Tamas Borbely

	IPv4Route/IPv6Route: added administrative distance field

	The route entries are sorted first by administrative distance, then by
	metric. When looking up the best route for a destination, then routes
	with lower administrative distances are preferred. Metrics are compared
	only if the administrative distances are the same.

	Default values for these distances are defined in RouteAdminDist enums,
	but they are set only for interface and static routes.

2012-01-17  Tamas Borbely

	Fix #498: IPv6 ping now works on routerless networks.
	The routing table contains an entry for the link local
	prefix according to RFC 4861 5.1.

2012-02-01  Tamas Borbely

	Bug #413 is fixed; IPv6 now works with PPP. It is achieved by disabling
	address resolution on point-to-point links.

2012-02-01  Tamas Borbely

	Fix #496: the destination cache does not return expired routes anymore.

2012-01-03  Tamas Borbely

	IPv6 tunneling is supported. Tunnels can be configured in the
	routing file, or can be dynamically added by the createTunnel()
	method of the IPv6Tunneling module.

	Note: IPv6Tunneling was used by xMIPv6, but was disabled when
	INET was compiled without the WITH_xMIPv6 flag.

2011-12-20  Tamas Borbely

	IPv6 module now ASSERTs that incoming datagrams do not
	have the errorBit set. It is assumed that those datagrams
	are dropped in the link layer.

2011-12-15  Tamas Borbely

	Transport layer don't have to specify the source address when
	sending a multicast datagram; the IPv6 module will use the source
	address of the outgoing interface. This earlier worked only for
	unicast datagrams.

	Note: if the destination is a solicited node multicast address (used
	during DAD), then the datagram can be sent with unspecified source
	address. Otherwise they are delayed until the interface obtains a
	non-tentative address.

2011-12-12  Tamas Borbely

	Fragmentation and reassembly of datagrams is implemented in the IPv6
	module. This fixes #470.

2011-12-07  Tamas Borbely

	Fix #473: ICMP errors are delivered to the higher layer
	protocol that sent the datagram triggering the error.
	This enables the UDP module to detect unopened ports.
	Only ICMP queries are passes to the ICMPv6 module.

2011-12-07  Tamas Borbely

	Fix #471: wrong Interface Identifier was generated from the
	MAC address.

	Now the 7th bit of the Interface Identifier is complemented to comply
	with RFC 4291 Appendix A.

2011-06-03  Andras Varga

	cosmetics: space usage made somewhat more consistent throughout the code

	Notes:
	- if you have an INET fork and want to compare the code, use the
	 "Ignore spaces" option of your visual diff tool. Most tools have
	 this option; Meld and Araxis Merge certainly do.

	- I used omnetpp/_scripts/tidymodel/spaces.pl, plus some manual tweaks

	Swiched NED documentation comments to explicit hyperlinking of NED
	type names, using tilde. Example: "TCP" was changed to "~TCP"
	wherever the module and not the protocol was meant.

	The reason for the switch was that autolinking produced too many
	false hits (e.g. "TCP connection" and "IP address" would link
	to the TCP and IP modules.)

	* RoutingTable6: properly fire notifications on routing table changes

2008-01-01..2009-03-25  Andras Varga, Rudolf Hornig

	Porting of INET to OMNeT++ 4.0, and some general face lift:
	* better directory structure (names changed to lowercase; moved sources
	  under src/; better names, e.g. networkinterfaces -> linklayer)
	* build system to use a deep makefile
	* updated the C++ code for the 4.0 API (follow name changes; use
	  int64-based simtime_t; use cPacket; etc.)
	* NED files converted to 4.0 syntax
	* make use of new features in NED files (module interfaces, inout
	  gates, @unit, etc.)

2005-08-04  Andras Varga

	* checked in the IPv6 model implemented by Ng Wei Yang at CTIE,
	Monash University; code skeleton and some initial code
	implemented by Andras Varga
